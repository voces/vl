# VL / Vital — Roadmap

The vision: a scripting-feel language with types **hidden by aggressive inference**, **permissive &
structural**, **fully type-safe** (statically sound — no untyped code; inference holes resolve to
concrete types), compiling to **lean WebAssembly**. Deliverables: an **LSP-backed VS Code extension**
(partial), a **CLI** (`deno task run`/`build`/`check`; native binary TBD), and an **in-browser
playground** (partial).

Status: 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started.

**Repo layout:** `compiler/` — the language core (compile, toAST, typecheck, toWasm, defaultScope) ·
`lsp/` — the VS Code extension + LSP server over the core · `grammar/` — the `.g4` spec (reference
only; the parser is hand-written) · `samples/` · `tests/` — `.vl` corpus + runner · `docs/` ·
`reference/` — retired ts-interpreter. Tracks are **independent** unless a dependency is called out.

> **Maintaining this file.** The roadmap is *forward-looking* — what to do next, why, dependencies,
> what's remaining.
> - *Shipped work?* → `CHANGELOG.md`.
> - *Why we chose something non-obvious?* → `DECISIONS.md`.
> - *How an already-done thing works?* → the code + git history, or a `docs/<subsystem>.md` explainer.
>
> Done items graduate to CHANGELOG. Partial items keep only the remaining/forward part. (Agents:
> on finishing, move the item to CHANGELOG as a one-liner; put rationale in `DECISIONS.md`.)

## Next (highest leverage)

- **Contextual parameter inference (A-infer-ctx)** — infer lambda param types from the expected
  function type at the call site (`xs.map(function(n) n*2)`). 🟡 In-progress
  (`claude/contextual-param-inference`).
- **Robustness floor (A-robust)** — an unresolved `Infer`/`Unknown` must yield a clear diagnostic,
  never a cryptic codegen crash (repro: `const xs = []; xs.push(1)`).
- **Exhaustiveness analysis for `is`-chains (A-exhaust)** — flag dead arms, enable omitting the
  final `else`, elide provably-true discriminants in codegen.
- **H4.1 / H4.5–H4.6** — remaining (worked-around) self-host codegen gaps for a full `vl build` path.
- **H2a Re-land clean `selfhost/lexer.vl`** — now unblocked; first concrete H3 slice.
- **C5 / H-M1** — `deno compile` + brew tap. Small, decoupled; ships the distribution story now.
- Smaller/independent: B6b collections building blocks, B13 callable objects, B17 lint backlog,
  A6b Stage A, A3 structural intersection merge.

---

## Track A — Type system (`typecheck.ts`)
*Blueprint: Elixir v1.20 set-theoretic types, fully-typed (no gradual escape hatch).*

- 🟡 **A3. Intersection types** (`A & B`). REMAINING: object-type structural intersection
  (`{x} & {y}` merge — needs `intersectType`/`meet` extension; today distinct objects meet to `Never`).
- 🟡 **A4. Negation types** (`!A`). REMAINING: full open-world negation tracking (needs A12).
- 🟡 **A5. Flow narrowing.** REMAINING: `case`/multi-guard (no grammar); stored-witness (A6b Stage B);
  optional *call* `x?.f()` + chain short-circuit `x?.y.z` (use `x?.y?.z`); per-call
  reachability-pruned return types (blocked on memoize-with-holes — see `docs/narrowing.md`).
- 🟡 **A6. `is` operator + tagged unions.** REMAINING: `ref.test` fast-path for ref-vs-ref; union
  arrays (`[boolean | i32]`); declared type-guard signatures (A6b Stage A).
- 🟡 **A6b. Proof-carrying narrowing (type guards as values).** REMAINING — **Stage A:** richer
  discriminants (`if bar(x) is null`), multi-input correlation, declared (verified) predicate
  signatures. **Stage B:** stored witness (`const f = bar(x); … if f is null` narrows x) — needs
  binding tracking + invalidation (a lightweight borrow). Stage B also subsumes per-call tight return
  types (the forward direction of the same correlation).
- ✅ **A7. Real `string` type.** `boolean`-where-`i32`-expected coercion done (A7b). (UTF-16 backing is B7.)
- ⬜ **A8. Exact / Inexact variance.** Params Inexact by default (accept excess properties), values
  Exact. Guards the `a.foo = b` width footgun. (TODO.md)
- ⬜ **A9. Readable / Writable variance.** Applied automatically during parameter inference. (TODO.md)
- 🟡 **A10. Parametric types / generics.** REMAINING: same `map`/`filter` generics for `Map`/`Set`
  (B6a); **const generics** (numeric/value type parameters, e.g. `Decimal<10, 8>` /
  `Buffer<N>`) — today generics take *type* params only; enabler for the parameterized
  `Decimal<Backing, Scale>` family (B2) and any fixed-size/parameter-by-value type.
  (Forward/mutual-reference return-type inference: shipped as A17 — see `CHANGELOG.md`.)
- 🟢 **A11. Recursive structural types.** Done: self-recursion, mutual recursion across *separate*
  `type` decls, AND recursion through an **array** element (`type List = { rest: List[] }` — the
  element struct, its list wrapper, and the backing array build in one WasmGC rec group). See `CHANGELOG.md`.
- 🟡 **A12. Soundness corpus.** REMAINING: keep growing it; the known-unsound corners are
  `xfail`-marked (e.g. the permissive `i32 + string` hole rule, A13).
  **Known bugs (all RESOLVED; pinned by passing cases):**
  - ✅ **A12-bug1. `is <literal>` always-false on literal-unions** — RESOLVED.
    (`literal-is-runtime-value.vl`; detail: `docs/soundness-findings.md` §literal-is-always-false)
  - ✅ **A12-bug2. Flat `A|B|null` `is`-chain "illegal cast" trap** — RESOLVED.
    (`struct-union-null-is-chain-sound.vl`; detail: `docs/soundness-findings.md` §struct-union-null-is-chain)
  - ✅ **A12-bug3. `x?.field` false error when `x` is typed via a named alias** — RESOLVED.
    (`optional-chain-coalesce-sound.vl`; detail: `docs/soundness-findings.md` §optional-chain-named-alias)
- 🟡 **A13. Operator-constraint inference.** REMAINING: the hole-operand rule is permissive (doesn't
  reject `i32 + string` yet); the *stored-closure* operator case (`vec + vec` via a `"+"` field)
  still hits the WasmGC width wall (B13).
- 🟡 **A14. Named/opaque types.** REMAINING: real **nominal/opaque types** (decision: clean-error-for-now → `DECISIONS.md`).
- 🟡 **A15. Equality.** REMAINING: a referential-identity operator (`===` / `identical`, O(1) `ref.eq`);
  `boolean`→i32 coercion when storing a comparison result.
- 🟡 **A16. Literal-union types.** REMAINING: the **enum representation** (i32 tag for a closed
  literal union — see `docs/unions.md`); a literal union read *inside* a body softens to base
  (coarser member-narrowing there than at the call boundary).
- ⬜ **A17 follow-up: `never` inference + `unconditional-recursion` lint.** A17 demand-driven inference
  is shipped. REMAINING: (a) infer `never` for a genuinely base-case-less divergent recursive cycle
  (currently a stopgap "annotate a return type" error); (b) an `unconditional-recursion` lint that fires
  even when the return type is explicitly annotated (catches accidental infinite loops).
- 🟡 **A-infer-ctx. Contextual parameter inference.** In-progress (`claude/contextual-param-inference`).
  Infer lambda/callback param types from the **expected function type** at the call site, e.g.
  `xs.map(function(n) n*2)` infers `n: i32` from `T[]`'s element type. Consistent with the
  "hide types where possible" identity; today untyped lambda params are a type error. Ties A10 (generic
  element type) and B15 (untyped lambdas).
- ⬜ **A-infer-empty. Usage-based inference for empty collections.** Infer `Map()`/`Set()`/`[]` element
  / key / value types from **later usage** (`m.set(k,v)`, `xs.push(x)`) — like evolving-array
  inference. Today `const xs = []` then `xs.push(1)` crashes with an `Infer`/`Unknown` codegen error
  rather than inferring `xs: i32[]` from the `push` constraint.
- ⬜ **A-infer-params. Top-level function param inference.** Infer named-function param types from
  usage constraints (HM / the existing A13 row-poly inference path), consistent with "hide types where
  possible." Requiring annotations on all named-fn params is NOT VL's stated stance.
- 🟡 **A-exhaust. Exhaustiveness analysis for `is`-chains.** Three sub-items all reuse the existing
  `conditionsExhaust` helper: (a) ✅ flag a **dead arm / dead `else`** after an already-exhaustive chain
  (`info` "unreachable: the preceding `is` arms are exhaustive"); (b) ✅ recognize exhaustiveness for
  return-coverage so the trailing `else` can be **omitted** (the checker sees the chain as covering);
  (c) ⬜ **codegen**: elide the provably-true final discriminant test + drop the dead arm — a type-driven
  optimization binaryen cannot do (it lacks union exhaustiveness). Runtime is already correct (the
  no-`else` fall-through lowers to `unreachable`); (c) is a pure size/speed optimization, deferred.
- ⬜ **A-robust. Robustness floor.** An unresolved `Infer`/`Unknown` type must produce a clear
  **"cannot infer — annotate"** diagnostic; it must NEVER surface as a cryptic `Unhandled "Unknown"
  type` codegen error or a `containsInfer` TypeError crash. Repro: `const xs = []; xs.push(1)`.
  Ties A-infer-empty (fixing that removes the main trigger).

---

## Track B — Codegen, memory model & runtime (`toWasm.ts`)
*Allocation = WasmGC; binaryen stays (it doesn't block self-hosting). → `DECISIONS.md`.*

- 🟡 **B2. Numeric codegen.** REMAINING: explicit value casting/coercion between numeric types
  (today only literals coerce); **`0x` hex / `0o` octal / `0b` binary integer literals + digit
  separators** (`1_000`, `0xFF_FF`) — a lexer/parser add; **arbitrary-precision `BigInt` and a
  `Decimal<Backing, Scale>` family** as future `std`-library generic types (not primitives).
  Prereq: const generics (A10).
- 🟡 **B5. Objects.** REMAINING: methods via `self`+UFCS (B14); typed literals in object values
  (`{n: 4<i64>}`); Exact-by-default for values (A8).
- 🟡 **B6. Collections — growable `T[]`.** REMAINING: in-place bulk append (deferred — will be
  `xs.push(...ys)` once variadics land); representation inference (§VL.7 — lower never-grown
  values to a header-less fixed array); `map`/`filter` build-side generics for `Map`/`Set` (A10);
  `.vl`-std migration once a module system exists. (design: `docs/collections-design.md`)
- 🟡 **B6a. `Map` + `Set`.** REMAINING: **i32-keyed Map/Set** (clean diagnostic for now — i32 keys
  use `T[]`); `for k in map` direct iteration (parser; use `.keys()` today); `map`/`filter` over
  Map/Set (A10); clean diagnostic polish for unannotated/used `Map()`.
- ⬜ **B6b. Collections building blocks & open items** (all detail in `docs/collections-design.md`).
  - **Prerequisite intrinsics** — `__array_new__`/`__array_new_default__` + bulk `__array_copy__`,
    thin `defaultScope` intrinsics.
  - **Std-over-primitives** — write the collection (and opportunistically `print`) as `.vl` std, not
    compiler-privileged types (ties to H3 / H0 phase 2 `std:` scheme).
  - **Indexing perf** (DECIDED resolutions; sub-choices open) — native-indexing flag (drops B13
    indirect call), backing-pointer hoisting (LICM), bounds-narrowing.
  - **Representation inference** (DECIDED direction; open compiler work) — infer fixed-array vs
    growable rep from usage; interprocedural + alias-unioned; co-design with variance (A9).
  - **Naming & forcing surface — UNCOMMITTED** — `T[]` + inference is the committed surface; names
    `List`/`Array` and any annotation to force a representation are deliberately open.
  - **Language-wide, still open** — value-vs-reference (default reference), error model.
  - **Deferred** — per-frame pooling; user-facing low-level array escape.
  - **Remaining open questions** — capacity/seed construction spelling; `map`/`filter` return type.
- 🟡 **B7. Strings.** REMAINING: switch backing to `(array mut i16)` + `wasm:js-string` builtins
  (bulk JS-host interop — dart2wasm/Kotlin-Wasm style); UTF-8/i8 packing (size); richer methods.
  **Strings direction:** `docs/strings-design.md` — long-term UTF-8 internal storage,
  code-point-indexed API made O(1) for the ASCII common case via an ASCII fast-path flag; strings
  immutable. Ties A7.
- 🟡 **B8. Loops.** REMAINING: `for…in` over objects/maps; `for val, i in arr` and `for , v in obj`
  destructuring forms.
- ⬜ **B12. `async`/`await`.** Keywords lexed; no semantics/codegen. Large; likely last.
- 🟡 **B13. Well-known-symbol dispatch.** REMAINING: callable objects (`"()"`).
- ⬜ **B13a. Multi-index matrix idiom** (low priority). Single-bracket `m[i, j]` → multi-arg
  `"[]"`/`"[]="` + flat-backed `Matrix`/`Grid` type. Nested `m[i][j]` already composes today.
- 🟡 **B14. Methods via explicit `self` + UFCS.** REMAINING: route operator dispatch (B13) through
  self-methods; `c.area` (no `()`) as a bound value; mutation/variance (A9).
- 🟡 **B15. Lambdas + declaration-vs-value.** REMAINING: **untyped** lambdas (a stored closure has
  one signature — needs pinning-by-use or boxing).
- ⬜ **B16. Redeclaration / overloading.** Current: same-scope redeclaration errors; nested shadowing
  allowed (uniquified in codegen). Future: ad-hoc overloading? Default "no" → `DECISIONS.md`.
- 🟡 **B17. Diagnostics + lint.** BUILD OUT — the lint rule backlog (a few at a time):
  - **prefer-`const`** — a `let` that is never reassigned should be `const` (info/warning + quick-fix).
  - **unused function / unused import**; **dead/constant branch** (`if false`); **`step 0`** range
    loop; **unreachable after a diverging `if/else`** (have the simple after-`return` case).
  - **LSP quick-fixes** (code actions): "remove unused binding" / "prefix with `_`" / "`let`→`const`".
    Diagnostics already carry stable `code`s; the LSP has no code-action provider yet.
  - ✅ **`vl check --fix`** — apply the provably-safe lint fixes from the CLI (`let`→`const`,
    unused→`_`-prefix), reusing `codeActions.ts`; idempotent, clean-file no-op.
  - Cross-cutting: thread `severity` through all remaining error variants; consistent message style.
- ⬜ **B18. Tail-call optimization** (low priority). binaryen 130 has `return_call`; detect tail
  position and emit it.
- 🐛 **B-bug. `while` as the tail statement of a void function crashes binaryen's Vacuum pass.**
  A `while` loop in *tail position* of a `void`-returning function body aborts inside binaryen
  optimization. Workaround: don't end a void function on a bare `while`. Fix: investigate the
  Vacuum-pass input for a result-less loop in tail position (likely a malformed/None-typed block tail).
- ⬜ **B-validwasm. Codegen must emit valid wasm WITHOUT relying on binaryen `optimize()`.** Some
  constructs (nullable-ref narrowing after null-checks, divergent loops, maps/sets, recursive types)
  currently produce valid wasm only after `optimize()` runs. The H4 self-hosted emitter path has no
  binaryen, so codegen must produce valid wasm pre-optimize. Surfaced by the `VL_NO_OPT` experiment;
  prerequisite for H4 / H-M2 (emit-bytes-directly). Audit each construct that relies on binaryen to
  legalize its output and fix the IR-builder to emit legal wasm directly.
- ⬜ **B20. Loops as expressions + `break <value>`.** Lift `for`/`while` into expression position;
  a loop evaluates to its `break` value or `null`. Three layers: grammar → types (mirror the
  `returnTypes` mechanism) → codegen (`__brk` block gets a result type).
- ⬜ **B21. `match` construct.** A `match` expression with **exhaustiveness-by-default**: a missing
  arm is a hard error (à la Rust/Swift), not a silent fall-through. The proper language home for
  enforced exhaustiveness on union/literal discrimination — complements the if-chain coverage check
  (A-exhaust) with structured syntax and compiler-enforced completeness. Design: arms match on type
  or literal; each arm is an expression; the `match` evaluates to the arm's type (union of arms).
- 🟡 **B-debug. Source maps + trap diagnostics follow-ups.** REMAINING: (1) **full source-mapped
  stack traces** — map every wasm frame in the trap's stack → VL `function (file:L:C)`, not just
  the top frame; (2) **value-rich panic messages** — a host `panic(msg)` abort path that formats
  the offending values (e.g. `index 7 out of bounds (length 3)`); (3) an index-assignment LHS has
  no parser span yet — broaden parser span coverage for OOB *write* errors. Also feasible: a
  **REPL** (accumulate-session-source + recompile-per-entry) as a future CLI item.

---

## Track C — CLI (`vl` / `vital`)

- 🟡 **C5. Distribution (public release).** REMAINING: tag / brew tap / sha256 bump — decoupled
  from all compiler work. (Shipping the binary: `deno task compile`/`smoke` already pass.)

---

## Track D — LSP / editor experience (`lsp/src/server.ts`)
*Mostly independent; benefits from Track A. AST nodes carry source spans (Track G).*

- 🟡 **D1. Hover types.** REMAINING: flow-narrowed receiver types; Map/Set members (when B6a fully lands).
- 🟡 **D3. Autocomplete.** REMAINING: wiring a completion provider into the Monaco playground (E).
- 🟡 **D4. Formatter.** REMAINING:
  - **Unfaithful-fallback constructs** — reproduced verbatim from the source span rather than
    regenerated: `type` aliases (body & span discarded by the checker), operator-named &
    method-shorthand functions, operator/index-method call desugars. (Trailing comments on `type`
    aliases now stay on their line — #146; functions with a commented expression body now fall back
    to verbatim correctly — #154; trailing comments on bare-body loop headers (`while`/`for`/`for-in`)
    now stay on the header line — #165; trailing comments on block closing braces now stay on that
    line — this PR.)
  - ~~**Trailing comment on bare-body loop header**~~ — `while cond // note` / `for … // note` (bare
    body): comment now stays on the header line, not expelled outside the enclosing function. Shipped.
  - ~~**Trailing comment on block closing brace**~~ — `} // note` on the closing `}` of `if`/`while`/
    `for`/`for-in`/function/free-standing blocks now stays on that line. Shipped.
  - **AST type-syntax fidelity gap** — the typechecker fully resolves every type it records (a tiny
    `i32` annotation becomes a giant structural `Object`; `type`-alias bodies and spans are
    discarded). Retain the *as-written* type syntax (or its span) so the AST is lossless for
    types — also benefits hover/inlay rendering (D1/D6/D8).
  - ~~**Trailing commas**~~ — multi-line wrapped lists emit trailing commas; already shipped.
- ✅ **D7. Cross-references in doc-comments** — rustdoc-style `` [`Name`] `` / `[Name]` intra-doc
  links in `///` comments; resolved via D2's symbol table; rewritten to clickable markdown links in
  hover and completion `documentation`. Cross-import resolution now done (H0 phase 3): a `Name` that
  is an imported binding links to the exporting sibling module's source location (`siblingUri#L…`),
  via the module graph's imported-name → source resolution (`lsp/src/moduleGraph.ts`).
- ⬜ **D8. Preserve type-alias names in display (the "`aliasSymbol`" gap).** Today a reference to
  an alias resolves *through* to its body before rendering (e.g. hover on `type thing = "a" | I32`
  shows `"a" | i32`). Fix: carry the alias name on the resolved type and let the renderer choose
  per context — **preserve** in hovers/inlay, **expand** in type-mismatch errors.
  **Manual step-expansion (owner ask):** expand one depth level at a time, on demand, via VS Code
  hover verbosity levels (`+`/`−` controls). Needs `stringifyType` to grow a `maxDepth` parameter;
  default hover = depth 0 (all names preserved); stepping reveals structure progressively.

---

## Track E — Browser playground + sandbox
*Depends on C1. The compiler is pure TS + binaryen (wasm), so it runs client-side.*

- 🟢 **E2. Playground UI.** Monaco editor + client-side LSP, branded light/dark theme pair
  (persisted; lock-step `data-mode` ↔ `monaco.editor.setTheme`), results-as-tabs
  (Output / WAT-with-size-badge / Diagnostics-with-count-badge), multi-file projects
  (one model per file, `inmemory://` URIs; per-file squiggles, aggregated Diagnostics that
  jump to file+line; whole-program Run/WAT via `compileProgram` → `N files → 1 module`),
  opt-in auto-run (always-on debounced diagnostics+WAT; opt-in execution), full-width status
  bar, real Share + Format wiring. (Sandboxed-Worker execution is E3.)
- ⬜ **E3. Sandboxed execution** — compiled user wasm in a Web Worker, fresh `Memory`, controlled
  `log` only, enforced limits. (Today user wasm runs on the main thread — fine for local use,
  harden before any public deploy.)

---

## Track F — Infrastructure & hygiene
*Independent; do continuously.*

- ⬜ **F2. Gate debug `console.log`s** in `toWasm.ts` behind a debug flag.
- ⬜ **F4. Re-enable inline `m.validate()`** during dev for earlier failure.
- ⬜ **F5. Settle the name** (VL vs Vital) and apply consistently.
- ⬜ **F6. Document the build** (`deno task build`/`test`; the antlr/gradle gen step is gone).
- ⬜ **F7. Fix the `paramater` misspelling** project-wide (optional; currently consistent).
- 🟡 **F8.** REMAINING (F5-adjacent): confirm vscode-languageclient forking the ESM server in VS Code.
- 🟡 **F9. Perf baseline.** Runtime benchmark shipped (`scripts/perf-runtime.ts` / `perf-compare.ts`).
  Cubic literal-union compile RESOLVED — `flattenType` all-literal dedup is now O(n)-per-flatten
  (O(n²) overall, was O(n³)); see CHANGELOG A16.
  **Perf wins identified (detail: `docs/perf-findings.md`):**
  - ✅ **F9c. Memoize `structSig`** — shipped (#107); see `CHANGELOG.md`. Post-fix: binaryen
    `optimize()` costs only ~0.8 s on the self-host module — NOT the bottleneck.
  - 🚫 **F9a. `VL_NO_OPT` / skip `optimize()` in tests — ABANDONED / SUPERSEDED.** The original
    premise was that `optimize()` dominates self-host compile time (~4 s/test). After the F9c
    `structSig` memoize fix (#107) the true bottleneck was eliminated: optimize is only ~0.8 s.
    F9a's projected ~20–25 s saving no longer applies. Keeping `VL_NO_OPT` as a "someday" option
    (LOW priority) if a future regression makes optimize a bottleneck again; not a near-term action.
    (detail: `docs/perf-findings.md`)
  - ⬜ **F9b. Cache / clone binaryen IR across selfhost sub-tests** — each of the 5
    `selfhost_pipeline_test.ts` sub-tests recompiles the same base source. Caching the binaryen IR
    for the shared base is more involved (binaryen modules are not trivially cloneable); LOW priority
    now that F9c removed the dominant cost.
    (detail: `docs/perf-findings.md` §Part 3 — Medium-Impact)

---

## Track G — Hand-written parser — ✅ DONE — see `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Track H — Self-hosting & distribution (the bootstrap end-state)
*The goal: VL compiles itself; the TypeScript/Deno host retires; the compiler becomes VL→wasm on a
generic wasm runtime. **Distribution does NOT require self-hosting** (the two timelines are
independent).*

- 🟡 **H0. Module system.** Phase 1 done — see `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - **Phase 2 (⬜):** the `std:` scheme + embedded `.vl` std over the two-primitive intrinsic floor
    (collections, `std:fmt`, `std:testing`).
  - **Phase 3 (🟡):** cross-file / std LSP. Module-aware DIAGNOSTICS landed (`lsp/src/moduleGraph.ts`):
    the open file is analyzed as the entry module — its imports resolve through a workspace
    `ModuleReader` (open buffers + disk), so imported names no longer flag "undeclared" and genuine
    import errors (bad path / not-exported / cycle) surface on the import line. Hover/completion seed
    the same imported-name types (real types, no squiggle). Cross-file NAVIGATION now landed:
    go-to-definition and doc-comment xrefs on an imported name jump to the EXPORTING sibling's
    declaration (resolved by reading the sibling through the workspace reader and locating the
    exported binding's decl span via the symbol table); find-references gathers occurrences across
    the current file + other OPEN documents + UNOPENED on-disk siblings (a name's canonical
    `(exportingKey, exportedName)` is matched per document; the importer's symbol table is
    graph-seeded so imported-name uses are recorded). On-disk crawl is scoped: project root detected
    from the LSP workspace-folder root, or by walking up to the nearest ancestor containing
    `deno.json`, `package.json`, or `.git` (at most 6 levels); `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`,
    `.claude`, `reference` dirs are skipped; at most 500 `.vl` files read per request
    (`MAX_DISK_FILES`); open-buffer text wins over disk for any file open in the editor.
    REMAINING: the `std:` scheme (phase 2).
  - **Deferred:** import maps, namespace/default imports, export-all, re-exports.
- 🟡 **H2. Make VL expressive enough to write a compiler.** All H2 gaps fixed — see `CHANGELOG.md`.
  REMAINING: maps (B6a), enum tag for literal-unions (A16).
- 🟡 **H2a. Re-land a clean `selfhost/lexer.vl`** (near-term, now unblocked). The spike PR #54 was
  closed "fix gaps, re-land clean"; with the H2 gaps fixed, re-land a lexer that drops the
  workarounds: hand-rolled `i32ToStr` → real `toString`, raw `\xXX` lexemes → `fromCodePoint`,
  struct-threaded scanner state → a real ref-typed module global. First concrete slice of H3.
- ⬜ **H3. Port the compiler to VL.** Rewrite `toAST`/`typecheck`/`toWasm` as `.vl`, validated by
  running the corpus through the VL-written compiler. Incremental; TS and VL compilers cross-checked.
  The front end self-hosts **from raw source text** today — `lexer.vl → parser.vl → typecheck.vl` is
  wired and test-validated (`tests/selfhost_pipeline_test.ts`) for a language **subset**. Remaining
  bootstrap work:
  - **(a) wasm-emit consuming the AST arena.** `emitProgram` now drives the real arena — i32
    params/arithmetic, calls/comparisons/`if`/`return`, `while` loops, `let`/`const` locals + assignment,
    structs (#137), arrays (#145), strings (literal, `.length`, index — lowered to the array-i32
    code-point representation), **growable `i32[]` + `.push`** (the `{backing,len,cap}` wrapper struct,
    grow-on-full mirroring `toWasm.ts`'s list rep), and **discriminated `type N = A | B` struct unions
    with `is`-narrowing** (G1, the bootstrap keystone the self-host AST `type Node` + the checker's
    `type Ty` depend on): the boxed `{tag, value:anyref}` tagged-struct rep, multiple variant struct
    heap types, `is` tag-discrimination, and the narrowing `ref.cast`+`struct.get` downcast — proven by
    real `WebAssembly.instantiate`. Ahead: arrays-of-unions (`Node[]`, G7-ref), unions mixing scalars +
    structs, `!is`/negated guards, non-i32 element lists, list `pop`/`+`/equality, and the broader
    self-host source vocabulary (`for`, `match`, nested arrays/maps). (The fixed-bytes spike that
    hand-built two modules without reading `compiler/ast.vl` is retired.)
  - **(b) Grow the `.vl` parser/typecheck subset.** `parseStmt` handles `let`/`const`/`function`/`if`
    (incl. `else if` chains)/`return`/block/expr but **no `while`/`for` statements yet**; widen toward
    the full language.
  - **(c) Land the `.vl` files on real import/export** to retire the concat + symbol-rename glue
    (the runner renames the lexer's colliding `Tok`/`Diag`/`advance`; detail: `docs/selfhost-gaps.md`
    §1). The multi-file substrate now exists (H0 phase 1).
  First slice (lexer) spiked + closed (#37, then #54) pending the H2 gap fixes; re-lands clean as
  `selfhost/lexer.vl` (H2a).
  **Codegen self-host status (detail: `docs/selfhost-gaps.md`):** the `wasmEmit.vl` spike is GREEN —
  LEB128 + section framing emit valid bytes that the real `WebAssembly` engine instantiates. H3-gap3,
  H4.2/H4.3/H4.4 are resolved (see `CHANGELOG.md`). The `emitProgram` frontier has advanced through
  **params, arithmetic, comparisons, calls/recursion, if/return, locals, while, structs (#137), arrays (#145),
  strings** (literal, `.length`, index — lowered to the array-i32 code-point representation), **and growable
  `i32[]` + `.push`** (the `{backing,len,cap}` wrapper struct with grow-on-full); ahead are non-i32 element
  lists, list `pop`/`+`/equality, and the wider self-host source vocabulary. Remaining sub-items:
  - ⬜ **H4.1. No `byte`/`u8` type (ergonomic/representation gap, not a blocker).** Bytes are
    represented as `i32` masked `& 0xff` in `wasmEmit.vl` and round-trip/instantiate fine; a real
    packed byte buffer (B7/B6 `(array i8)`) would drop the 4×-wide detour. (detail: `docs/selfhost-gaps.md` §H4.1)
  - ⬜ **H4.5. In-VL byte→host handoff (worked around).** Bytes are serialized via a decimal-join
    string (`bytesToStr()`); the real fix (linear-memory/`(array i8)` return or a host sink) only
    matters for a standalone `vl build`, not for proving self-host. (detail: `docs/selfhost-gaps.md` §H4.5)
  - ⬜ **H4.6. Array spread / concat in call position (worked around).** A small `appendAll()` loop
    helper covers bulk-append today; `xs.push(...ys)` lands with variadics (B6). (detail: `docs/selfhost-gaps.md` §H4.6)
- ⬜ **H4. WASM emission — DECIDED: emit bytes directly + optional `wasm-opt`** (binaryen's npm
  build is JS-bound). → `DECISIONS.md`. binaryen stays for the TS compiler.
- ⬜ **H-M2. Wasm-native distribution (end-state).** The `vl` binary becomes a wasm runtime
  (wasmtime — full WasmGC since v27) + a small host shim. No V8, no binaryen, no Deno.
- ⬜ **H5. Versioning — deferred; rustup/Volta model, not nvm** (→ `DECISIONS.md`). Make the H-M1
  install path version-stamped so a launcher can slot in later.

**Sequence:** H-M1 (now) → H2 (B6a maps + A16 enum tag) → H2a (clean lexer) → H3 port → H-M2
host swap. Cost is dominated by H2/H3; H4 decided.
