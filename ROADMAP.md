# VL / Vital — Roadmap

The vision: a scripting-feel language with types **hidden by aggressive inference**,
**permissive & structural**, **fully type-safe** (statically sound — there is no
untyped code; inference holes resolve to concrete types), compiling to **lean
WebAssembly**. Deliverables:
**LSP-backed VS Code extension** (exists, partial) · **CLI to compile/run** (missing) ·
**in-browser playground with a sandbox** (missing).

Status legend: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started.

**Repo layout** (restructured June 2026): `compiler/` — the language core (compile,
toAST, toWasm, defaultScope + generated `antlr/`), owned by nobody else · `lsp/` — the
VS Code extension/LSP client+server over the core · `cli/` (future) · `playground/`
(future) · `grammar/` — the `.g4` spec + antlr gen project · `samples/` · `tests/` —
`.vl` corpus + runner · `docs/` · `reference/` — retired ts-interpreter. Single root
`package.json`/`node_modules` (so esbuild resolves deps from both `compiler/` and `lsp/`)
and root `deno.json` (workspace config + test/lint).

The tracks below are **independent** unless a dependency is called out. Within a
track, items are roughly ordered. See `docs/language-todo.md` for prose on the
closures / `is` / variance designs referenced here.

---

## Track A — Type system (`toAST.ts`)
*Blueprint: Elixir v1.20 set-theoretic types, adapted for a **fully-typed** language
(no `dynamic`/gradual escape hatch — VL has no untyped code). Independent of codegen.*

- 🟡 **A0. Inventory the existing type algebra.** Have: `Alias`, `Function`, `Object`
  (structural, with index signatures), literal types (`IntegerLiteral`/`RealLiteral`/
  `StringLiteral`/`BooleanLiteral`), `Union`, `Nullable`, `Unknown`, `Never`, `Type`,
  `Infer`, `Custom` (predicate). Missing the rest below. Note: `Unknown`/`Infer` are
  **inference holes that resolve** to concrete types, not a runtime `dynamic` — VL is
  fully typed, so there is no gradual escape hatch.
- ⬜ **A3. Intersection types** (`A & B`). Needed for narrowing results and structural
  refinement. Round out the set-theoretic algebra.
- ⬜ **A4. Negation types** (`not A`). Needed so guards can subtract types on the false
  branch.
- ⬜ **A5. Flow narrowing.** Refine a variable's type along control flow (`if`, future
  `case`, guards). Depends on A3/A4. This is what makes structural types precise.
- ⬜ **A6. `is` operator** (ducktype `instanceof`/`typeof` replacement, from TODO.md).
  The guard primitive that feeds A5: `if x is string then …`.
- ⬜ **A7. Real `string` type.** Currently a half-baked `Alias`. Make it a proper object
  type with its methods/operators (mirrors how numerics are modeled in `defaultScope.ts`).
- ⬜ **A8. Exact / Inexact variance** (TODO.md). Params Inexact by default (accept excess
  properties), values Exact. Guard the `a.foo = b` footgun noted in TODO.md.
- ⬜ **A9. Readable / Writable variance** (TODO.md). Applied automatically during
  parameter inference.
- ⬜ **A10. Parametric types / generics.** `function foo<T>(x: T)`. Elixir defers these too —
  hard. Needed for real collections.
- ⬜ **A11. Recursive types.** `getConcreteType` explicitly punts on recursion today.
  Needed for trees/lists/JSON-shaped data.
- ⬜ **A12. Soundness pass / test suite.** Port the "If T" narrowing benchmark idea; build
  a corpus of "must-error" and "must-not-error" programs. Define the soundness contract
  (statically sound — every well-typed program is type-safe at runtime).

---

## Track B — Codegen, memory model & runtime (`toWasm.ts`)
*The "no-GC vs WasmGC" decision lives here. Recommendation: make placement a compiler
decision — escape analysis stack-allocates non-escaping values; escaping values go to
WasmGC; keep manual linear memory as an opt-in escape hatch.*

*Dependency decision: **keep binaryen** (unlike antlr4 — Track G). It's pure WASM/JS,
does the heavy lifting (IR + validation + optimizer), supports WasmGC types (helps
B1/B4), and is a library binding that does **not** block self-hosting. The binaryen
patch was **removed** (F8 done): the LSP server now builds as ESM, where binaryen's
top-level await is legal, so `patch-package` and the 242KB patch are gone. `toWasm`
stays tolerant of both binaryen forms (sync object / async init).*

- ✅ **B0. Numeric literals + i32/f64 arithmetic, if/while, direct calls, `__program__`
  start fn, memory builtins.**
- ✅ **B1. Allocation strategy DECIDED: WasmGC** (June 2026). The heap phase (closures,
  objects, arrays, strings) builds on WasmGC structs/arrays; linear memory stays as an
  opt-in escape hatch; escape-analysis stack-allocation is a later optimization.
  **binaryen upgraded 116→130** for the ergonomic GC API (`module.struct`/`module.array`/
  `TypeBuilder` — absent in 116). The old upgrade blocker (binaryen TLA breaking CJS) is
  moot since the LSP server is ESM. Only API drift: `i64.const` now takes a single bigint.
- 🟡 **B2. Finish numeric codegen.** i64 & f32 binary ops are not wired (only i32/boolean/
  f64 branches exist). Add numeric **casting/coercion** (none today).
- 🟡 **B3. First-class functions / indirect calls** (working for the single-shape case).
  A function value is an **i32 index into a wasm function table** (`addTable` +
  `addActiveElementSegment`); function-typed locals/params hold that index and
  `call_indirect` dispatches on it. Functions are instantiated lazily (per resolved name)
  and emit at most once — a direct call compiles the callee against its **call-site
  argument types**, so an un-annotated higher-order param works: `function apply(fn, a, b)
  fn(a, b)` infers `fn` is a 2-arg function (see A6-adjacent inference in `toAST.ts`) and
  monomorphizes. Indirect-call signatures and inferred return types are read back from the
  monomorphized scope / compiled body (`getExpressionType`), not the once-inferred AST.
  **Remaining (→ A10):** true per-shape monomorphization — today there is one wasm instance
  per resolved name, so calling the *same* inferred-generic function with two different type
  shapes (e.g. `apply(addi, …)` then `apply(addf, …)`) fails validation. Emit `name$i32` /
  `name$f64` instances keyed on the concrete signature. See `vl-current-work-indirect-calls`.
- 🟡 **B4. Closures** — **non-escaping closures WORK** (the project's first WasmGC codegen).
  DONE:
  1. **Nested function declarations** — a function-body block caches its value type during the
     walk (so return-type inference survives the scope pop), and Block codegen registers nested
     decls like the Program case.
  2. **Capture analysis** — `instantiate` compiles a capturing body twice: pass 1 collects the
     captured names (placeholders, body discarded) via a function-boundary check in
     `lookupName`; pass 2 recompiles against the env.
  3. **Environment struct** — a WasmGC struct (`TypeBuilder`, one immutable field per capture);
     the callee takes a hidden leading `(ref env)` param and each captured read is a
     `struct.get` on it.
  4. **Non-escaping call** — call sites `struct.new` the env from the captures' current values
     (read in the caller's scope) and thread it as the hidden leading arg.
  Captures are **read-only and numeric** for now. Test: `functions/closure.vl` (15, 110).
  REMAINING:
  - **Escaping closures** — a capturing function used as a *value* throws a clear guard today
    (the function table holds a bare funcref, no env). Make a function value a **fat pointer**
    (closure struct: funcref + env), call via `call_ref`, unifying with B3's table. The big
    one — reworks the i32-table-index function-value representation.
  - **Mutable / non-numeric captures** — writing to a captured var (needs boxing / a mutable
    env field) and capturing refs (objects, strings — depends on B5/B7).
  Depends on B1 (done) + B3 (done).
- 🟡 **B5. Objects in codegen** — structural objects compile to **WasmGC structs** (reusing
  the closure struct machinery). `{x,y}` → `struct.new`; `p.x` → `struct.get`; `p.x = v` →
  `struct.set`. Shapes are interned by a canonical signature (fields sorted by name, mutable),
  so identical shapes share a struct type. `toWasmType` maps a structural Object to its struct
  ref. Test: `objects/struct.vl`. Also fixed a parser precedence bug this surfaced: member-access
  *reads* (`.`/`[]`) bound looser than arithmetic (`a.x + b.y` mis-parsed as `(a.x + b).y`) —
  moved them above the operators in `VL_Parser.g4` + regen. REMAINING: non-numeric/nested
  field types beyond the basics, objects as function args/returns (should work via the struct
  ref but untested), excess-property/structural-subtype coercion at boundaries, methods.
- ⬜ **B6. Arrays in codegen** (WasmGC arrays or linear memory). Depends on B1.
- ⬜ **B7. Strings in codegen.** Depends on A7 + B1.
- 🟡 **B8. Loops: wire `for` `step`** (parsed/typechecked but hardcoded `+1`), and
  implement `for…in` over arrays/objects (aspirational in `samples/loops.vl`).
- 🟡 **B9. `break` in codegen** (only `continue` is handled); verify labeled break/continue.
- ⬜ **B10. Prefix/postfix ops in codegen** (`++ -- not !`) — parsed & in the interpreter,
  not in the wasm path.
- ⬜ **B11. `while true` return analysis.** Compiler can't prove an infinite loop always
  returns (malloc has a trailing-`0` workaround). Special-case or add proper reachability.
- ⬜ **B12. `async`/`await`.** Keywords exist in the lexer; no semantics or codegen.
  Large; likely last.

## Track C — CLI (`vl` / `vital` command)
*New surface. Depends on the existing parse→AST→wasm pipeline being callable outside the
LSP (today `toWasm` only runs inside `server.ts`).*

- ✅ **C1. Extract a headless `compile(source) → { wasm, diagnostics }`** entry point,
  decoupled from the LSP. Done — `compiler/compile.ts` is the single source of truth shared
  by the LSP, `tests/run.ts`, and (future) CLI + browser.
- ⬜ **C2. `vl run <file>`** — compile + instantiate + execute, wiring the `log` import
  (host stdout) the way `server.ts` does today.
- ⬜ **C3. `vl build <file> -o out.wasm`** — emit `.wasm` (and optional `.wat`).
- ⬜ **C4. `vl check <file>`** — diagnostics only, exit code for CI.
- ⬜ **C5. Decide CLI runtime/distribution** — Deno (`deno compile` for a binary) vs Node.
  Affects packaging.

---

## Track D — LSP / editor experience (`server.ts`)
*Mostly independent; benefits from Track A.*

- ✅ **D0. Diagnostics** (parse + type errors) on change.
- ⬜ **D1. Hover types.** `stringifyType` already exists — surface it on hover.
- ⬜ **D2. Go-to-definition / find-references** (needs symbol→source-range tracking;
  AST nodes currently drop most ctx).
- ⬜ **D3. Autocomplete** (scope-aware; structural members).
- ⬜ **D4. Formatter** (+ `vl fmt` in the CLI).
- ⬜ **D5. Semantic tokens** (richer than the TextMate `syntaxes/vital.tmLanguage.json`).
- ⬜ **D6. Inlay hints** for inferred types — *the* feature for a "types are hidden" language.

---

## Track E — Browser playground + sandbox
*Depends on C1 (headless compile). The compiler is pure TS + Binaryen (WASM), so it can
run client-side.*

- ⬜ **E1. Bundle the compiler for the browser** (esbuild target browser; Binaryen runs in
  wasm already).
- ⬜ **E2. Playground UI** — editor (Monaco) + output pane. Reuse the LSP via
  `monaco-languageclient` or run diagnostics inline.
- ⬜ **E3. Sandboxed execution.** Run compiled user wasm in a **Web Worker** with a fresh
  `WebAssembly.Memory`, no host imports except a controlled `log`; enforce limits
  (memory cap, timeout, no network/DOM). The wasm sandbox + worker isolation is the
  security boundary.
- ⬜ **E4. Shareable links** (encode source in URL / gist).

---

## Track G — Replace antlr4 with a hand-written parser
*Goal: drop the antlr4 dependency. Independent; safe to do incrementally because
the `.vl` test corpus is parser-agnostic and `compile()` isolates the parser.*

Why drop it:
- **Heavyweight non-JS build step.** Regenerating the parser (`deno task gen`)
  needs Java + Gradle + the antlr4 gradle plugin — bolted onto a Deno/TS project.
  Every new syntax feature (e.g. the `is` operator) requires a regen.
- **Large committed generated code that drifts.** `VL_Parser.ts`/`VL_Lexer.ts`
  are committed in two places and copied around; they've already drifted (the
  dead interpreter test, a stray `override` type error in the generated parser).
- **Awkward CST→AST layer.** Half of `toAST.ts` is spelunking the untyped parse
  tree (`ctx.expr(0)`, `ctx.LBRACK()`, null-checks). Precedence is encoded as
  ordered `expr` alternatives; newline handling is `NEWLINE*` sprinkled everywhere.
- **Bootstrap blocker.** A Java-toolchain-generated parser can never be part of a
  self-hosted VL compiler. A hand-written one is a stepping stone toward it.

- ⬜ **G1. Hand-written lexer.** The lexer is already essentially a token list
  (`VL_Lexer.g4`); reimplement directly in TS. Cleaner significant-newline
  handling than `NEWLINE*` everywhere.
- ⬜ **G2. Recursive-descent statements + Pratt/precedence-climbing expressions.**
  Pratt handles the operator-precedence cascade elegantly. **Emit the typed AST
  (`VLExpression`/`VLStatement`) directly**, collapsing the CST→AST translation
  out of `toAST.ts` (the type-checking half stays). Full control over error
  messages and incremental parsing; no build step, no generated blob.
- ⬜ **G3. Keep `.g4` (or an EBNF doc) as the human-readable grammar spec.**
- ⬜ **G4. Delete antlr4 deps, the gradle project, generated dirs, and the
  `gen` task.** The `.vl` corpus validates behavior across the swap.
- Alternatives considered: a pure-JS PEG generator (peggy) drops Java but keeps a
  generic tree + a dep; parser combinators similar. Hand-written wins on errors
  and bootstrappability for a grammar this small.

---

## Track F — Infrastructure & hygiene
*Independent; do continuously.*

- ✅ **F1. Test harness for the wasm path.** `deno task test` runs `tests/run.ts` over a
  black-box `.vl` corpus with `// @directive` expectations. (`reference/ts-interpreter`
  was the only prior test; excluded via `deno.json`.)
- ⬜ **F2. Strip / gate debug `console.log`s** in `toWasm.ts` (getFunction, "???",
  emitText dumps) behind a debug flag.
- ✅ **F3. Retired `ts-interpreter/` → `reference/ts-interpreter/`** (stale tree-walking
  backend; kept for reference, excluded from tests/lint).
- ⬜ **F4. Re-enable inline `m.validate()`** during dev (currently only the final validate
  runs) for earlier failure.
- ⬜ **F5. Settle the name** (VL vs Vital vs Vital Language) and apply consistently.
- ⬜ **F6. Document grammar regen** (`deno task gen`, needs gradle + the antlr4 project)
  and the build (`deno task build`).
- ⬜ **F7. Fix the `paramater` misspelling** project-wide (optional; currently consistent).
- ✅ **F8. Dropped `patches/binaryen+116.0.0.patch` + `patch-package`.** The LSP server
  now builds as **ESM** (`dist/server.mjs`, `--format=esm`); the client stays CJS
  (`dist/extension.js`). binaryen's top-level await is legal in ESM, so no patch is
  needed. Cleared all 9 `npm audit` advisories (77→13 packages). Verified headlessly:
  esbuild-bundled unpatched binaryen compiles + runs a VL program under Node. **Still to
  confirm in VS Code (F5):** vscode-languageclient forking an ESM server over IPC.

---

## Suggested first moves (highest leverage, lowest risk, mostly independent)
1. ✅ **C1** — headless `compile()`. Done: unblocked the CLI, the browser, *and* the
   `tests/run.ts` corpus.
2. **B3** — finish indirect calls (in flight) to unblock closures (B4).
3. **A6 + A5** — `is` operator + flow narrowing. The set-theoretic payoff for a fully-typed
   language: structural guards that refine types along control flow (needs A3/A4 first).
