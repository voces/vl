# VL / Vital — Roadmap

The vision: a scripting-feel language with types **hidden by aggressive inference**, **permissive &
structural**, **fully type-safe** (statically sound — no untyped code; inference holes resolve to
concrete types), compiling to **lean WebAssembly**. Deliverables: an **LSP-backed VS Code extension**
(partial), a **CLI** (`deno task run`/`build`/`check`; native binary TBD), and an **in-browser
playground** (missing).

Status: ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started.

**Repo layout:** `compiler/` — the language core (compile, toAST, typecheck, toWasm, defaultScope) ·
`lsp/` — the VS Code extension + LSP server over the core · `grammar/` — the `.g4` spec (reference
only; the parser is hand-written) · `samples/` · `tests/` — `.vl` corpus + runner · `docs/` ·
`reference/` — retired ts-interpreter. Tracks are **independent** unless a dependency is called out.

> **Maintaining this file.** The roadmap is *forward-looking* — what to do, why, dependencies, what's
> remaining. It is **not** a changelog. Rule of thumb:
> - *Helps decide what to do next?* → here.
> - *Why we chose something non-obvious?* → `DECISIONS.md`.
> - *How an already-done thing works?* → the code + git history, or a `docs/<subsystem>.md` explainer
>   only where the mental model aids future work (`docs/unions.md`, `docs/narrowing.md`).
>
> Done items collapse to a one-line breadcrumb. Don't paste implementation narrative here. (Agents:
> on finishing, set the item to a one-line done marker; put rationale in `DECISIONS.md`.)

## Track A — Type system (`typecheck.ts`)
*Blueprint: Elixir v1.20 set-theoretic types, fully-typed (no gradual escape hatch).*

- ✅ **A0. Type-algebra inventory.** `Alias`, `Function`, `Object` (structural + index sigs), literal
  types, `Union`, `Nullable`, `Intersection`, `Negation`, `Unknown`/`Infer` (resolving holes),
  `Never`, `Type`, `Custom`.
- 🟡 **A3. Intersection types** (`A & B`). Done as narrowing algebra (`intersectType`, the then-branch
  refinement; → `docs/narrowing.md`). REMAINING: surface syntax (`A & B` annotation) + uses beyond
  narrowing.
- 🟡 **A4. Negation types** (`not A`). Done as narrowing algebra (`subtractType`, the else-branch).
  REMAINING: surface syntax (`not A`); full open-world negation tracking (needs A12).
- 🟡 **A5. Flow narrowing.** Done broadly — nullness, union-member (then `A` / else `U − A`),
  post-guard guard-clauses, `&&`/`||` chains (short-circuit, multi-place, De Morgan), else-of-else-if
  chaining, literal discrimination, `?.`/`??`. See **`docs/narrowing.md`**. REMAINING: `case`/multi-
  guard (no grammar); stored-witness (A6b Stage B); optional *call* `x?.f()` + chain short-circuit
  `x?.y.z` (use `x?.y?.z`); per-call reachability-pruned return types (blocked on memoize-with-holes —
  see `docs/narrowing.md`).
- 🟢 **A6. `is` operator + tagged unions.** Done — `x is T` discriminates an arbitrary value union at
  runtime (niche / value-kind / boxed encodings, global tag registry, `coerceUnion` at boundaries).
  See **`docs/unions.md`**. REMAINING: `ref.test` fast-path for ref-vs-ref; union arrays
  (`[boolean | i32]`); declared type-guard signatures (A6b Stage A).
- 🟡 **A6b. Proof-carrying narrowing (type guards as values).** Narrowing as a fact carried by a
  return value; discriminating the (possibly stored) witness refines the input that produced it. Done
  (degenerate, immediately-consumed): a body that is exactly `return <predicate-on-a-param>` is an
  inferred guard — `if present(v) { v.x }`, and the guard-clause `if absent(v) { return }`.
  REMAINING — **Stage A:** richer discriminants (`if bar(x) is null`), multi-input correlation,
  declared (verified) predicate signatures. **Stage B:** the *stored witness* (`const f = bar(x); …
  if f is null` narrows x) — needs binding tracking + invalidation (a lightweight borrow). Stage B
  also subsumes per-call tight return types (the forward direction of the same correlation).
- 🟡 **A7. Real `string` type.** Done (core): a proper Object (`{[i32]: i32}` index sig → i32-array of
  char codes, `.length`/`s[i]`/`+`/`==`). REMAINING: richer methods (slice, indexOf); `boolean`-where-
  `i32`-expected coercion. (UTF-16 backing is B7.)
- ⬜ **A8. Exact / Inexact variance.** Params Inexact by default (accept excess properties), values
  Exact. Guards the `a.foo = b` width footgun. (TODO.md)
- ⬜ **A9. Readable / Writable variance.** Applied automatically during parameter inference. (TODO.md)
- ⬜ **A10. Parametric types / generics** (`function foo<T>(x: T)`). Hard (Elixir defers it). Needed
  for real collections → the main remaining gap for self-hosting (Track H/H2).
- 🟢 **A11. Recursive structural types.** Done — `type Tree = { value, left: Tree | null, … }`
  constructs/traverses/compiles (cycle-safe traversals + a self-referential WasmGC struct rec-group;
  `types/recursive-tree.vl`). REMAINING: mutual recursion across *separate* `type` decls; recursion
  through an **array** element (`{ rest: [List] }`); bodyless `type Point` still errors cleanly (A14).
- 🟡 **A12. Soundness corpus.** Done (started): a must-error / must-not-error `.vl` corpus under
  `tests/cases/soundness/`; the runner is strict-by-default. REMAINING: keep growing it; the
  known-unsound corners are `xfail`-marked (e.g. the permissive `i32 + string` hole rule, A13).
- 🟡 **A13. Operator-constraint inference (row-polymorphic generics).** Done (core): a fully-inferred
  structural function (`add(self, b) { x: self.x + b.x, … }`) monomorphizes per call shape (i32 & f64
  from two call sites). REMAINING: the hole-operand rule is permissive (doesn't reject `i32 + string`
  yet); the *stored-closure* operator case (`vec + vec` via a `"+"` field) still hits the WasmGC
  width wall (B13).
- 🟡 **A14. Named/opaque type robustness.** The bodyless-`type Point` infinite-recursion crash is
  fixed (cycle-guarded `getConcreteType`; it now errors cleanly). REMAINING: real **nominal/opaque
  types** (decision: clean-error-for-now → `DECISIONS.md`).
- 🟡 **A15. Equality.** Done — `==`/`!=` are structural by value; functions by reference; arrays + nested
  structs recurse via a shared `valueEq` helper, gated by `isEquatable`. (→ `DECISIONS.md`.) REMAINING:
  a referential-identity operator (`===` / `identical`, O(1) `ref.eq`); `boolean`→i32 coercion when
  storing a comparison result.
- 🟡 **A16. Literal-union types (enums-as-unions).** Done (type-level): annotations constrain
  (`"a"|"b"` rejects `"c"`); `==`/`!=` discriminate + narrow; a numeric-literal union is its base
  scalar for arithmetic; a covering `if/else if` chain is **exhaustive** (no spurious `| null`). (→
  `DECISIONS.md`.) REMAINING: the **enum representation** (i32 tag for a closed literal union — see
  `docs/unions.md`); a literal union read *inside* a body softens to base (coarser member-narrowing
  there than at the call boundary).

---

## Track B — Codegen, memory model & runtime (`toWasm.ts`)
*Allocation = WasmGC; binaryen stays (it doesn't block self-hosting). → `DECISIONS.md`.*

- ✅ **B0. Numeric literals, i32/f64 arithmetic, if/while, direct calls, start fn, memory builtins.**
- ✅ **B1. Allocation strategy = WasmGC** (binaryen 116→130 for the GC API). → `DECISIONS.md`.
- 🟡 **B2. Numeric codegen.** Done: i64 & f32 arithmetic + float `/` & comparisons; i64/f32 type
  mappings; range-aware integer-literal defaults. REMAINING: explicit value casting/coercion between
  numeric types (today only literals coerce).
- ✅ **B3. First-class functions / indirect calls + per-shape monomorphization.** A function value is
  a fat-pointer closure `{ tableIndex, env }`; each call site instantiates a fresh signature, keyed in
  codegen by wasm param signature. (See `vl-monomorphization` memo; folds into A10.)
- ✅ **B4. Closures** (the first WasmGC codegen) — nested decls, capture analysis, env struct,
  escaping closures. REMAINING: mutable captures (boxing / a mutable env cell).
- 🟡 **B5. Objects.** Done on WasmGC structs — literals, read/write, nested, f64 fields, args/returns,
  reassignment, captured-in-closures, excess-property width subtyping, function-valued fields +
  member-call. REMAINING: methods via `self`+UFCS (B14); method-shorthand `{ add(a,b) … }` (parser);
  typed literals in object values (`{n: 4<i64>}`); Exact-by-default for values (A8).
- 🟡 **B6. Arrays** (WasmGC). MVP done: fixed-length arrays — literal/`a[i]`/`a[i]=v`/`a.length`,
  bounds-trap. Size-member design DECIDED (→ `DECISIONS.md`). REMAINING: growable list/vector
  (`{ array, len, cap }`, tier 2).
- ⬜ **B6a. Maps / non-string keys** (`Map<K,V>` — a separate hash type, not every-object-as-table; →
  `DECISIONS.md`). Index sigs `{[string]: T}` type-check but are dropped at codegen — this is their
  codegen, via B13's `"[]"`/`"[]="` traps. Deferred.
- 🟡 **B7. Strings.** Done (core): WasmGC i32-array of code points — literal, `.length`/`s[i]`, `+`,
  `==`/`!=`, `print`. REMAINING: switch the backing to `(array mut i16)` + `wasm:js-string` builtins
  (bulk JS-host interop — what dart2wasm/Kotlin-Wasm do); UTF-8/i8 packing (size); richer methods.
- 🟡 **B8. Loops.** Done: `for…in` over arrays, direction-aware `step`, single-line block bodies,
  empty-range warning. REMAINING: `for…in` over objects/maps; `for val, i in arr` and `for , v in obj`
  destructuring forms.
- ✅ **B9. `break` / `continue` in codegen** (incl. labelled `break outer`).
- ✅ **B10. Unary / prefix / postfix ops** (`-`, `++`/`--`, `!`; → `DECISIONS.md` for `!`-not-`not`).
  Minor gaps: `++`/`--` are i32-only and operate on a `Name` (not `o.x++` / `a[i]++`).
- ✅ **B11. `while true` return analysis** — a non-escaping `while true` types as `Never`, so a
  function tail'd by one returns via its inner `return`s with no spurious `| null`.
- ⬜ **B12. `async`/`await`.** Keywords lexed; no semantics/codegen. Large; likely last.
- 🟡 **B13. Well-known-symbol dispatch (operator / call / index).** Done: operator overloading — a
  user-shape operand dispatches through its operator method (stored-closure field *or*, for object-
  shaped operands like `vec + vec`, a free `self`-named operator function that monomorphizes per call).
  (→ `DECISIONS.md`.) REMAINING: callable objects (`"()"`) + index traps (`"[]"`/`"[]="`).
- 🟡 **B14. Methods via explicit `self` + UFCS (no `this`).** Done (core): a free `self`-first
  function is callable as `o.f(args)` (rewrites to `f(o, args)`, monomorphized per receiver);
  resolution order field-then-self-fn; non-`self` functions aren't instance-reachable. (Full decision
  set → `DECISIONS.md`.) REMAINING: route operator dispatch (B13) through self-methods; `c.area`
  (no `()`) as a bound value; mutation/variance (A9).
- 🟡 **B15. Lambdas + the declaration-vs-value distinction.** Done (typed): a `FunctionDeclaration` in
  value position lowers to its closure value (let-bound, capturing, higher-order, inline object
  fields). (Syntax + decl-vs-value decisions → `DECISIONS.md`.) REMAINING: **untyped** lambdas (a
  stored closure has one signature — needs pinning-by-use or boxing); method-shorthand parser sugar.
- ⬜ **B16. Redeclaration / overloading.** Current: same-scope redeclaration errors; nested shadowing
  is allowed (uniquified in codegen). Future: ad-hoc overloading? Default "no, one binding per name
  per scope" (→ `DECISIONS.md`).
- 🟡 **B17. Diagnostics.** Started: `severity` (error/warning/info), a `@warning` test directive, the
  empty-range warning. BUILD OUT: thread `severity` through all error variants; stable diagnostic
  codes; a real lint pass (unused vars, unreachable code, dead branches, `step 0`); LSP quick-fixes;
  consistent message style.
- ⬜ **B18. Tail-call optimization** (low priority). binaryen 130 has `return_call`; detect tail
  position and emit it. Deprioritized — correctness is fine; this is a depth/perf optimization.
- ✅ **B19. `return` / early returns** (early, from loops, fall-through; a bare `return` yields null).
- ⬜ **B20. Loops as expressions + `break <value>`.** Lift `for`/`while` into expression position; a
  loop evaluates to its `break` value or `null` (a natural *search* expression — `let found = for x
  in xs { if test(x) { break x } }` → `Nullable<elem>`). Three layers: grammar → types (mirror the
  `returnTypes` mechanism) → codegen (`__brk` block gets a result type). Labels need a per-loop
  break-value collector stack.

---

## Track C — CLI (`vl` / `vital`)

- ✅ **C1. Headless `compile(source) → { ast, wasm, diagnostics }`** (`compiler/compile.ts`), shared
  by the LSP, the test runner, and the CLI.
- ✅ **C2. `vl run`** — compile + run a file / `-e` snippet / stdin (`deno task run`). Drives the VS
  Code Run-Current-File command.
- ✅ **C3. `vl build <file> [-o out.wasm] [--wat]`** — emit wasm bytes (and optional `.wat`).
- ✅ **C4. `vl check <file>`** — diagnostics only, non-zero exit on errors (CI gate).
- 🟡 **C5. Distribution via `deno compile`** — native `vl` binary builds (`deno task compile` →
  `scripts/build-binary.ts`) and **binaryen.js verified to run inside the compiled binary, no flags**
  (`deno task smoke`); cross-compile workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` + draft `Formula/vl.rb`
  (→ `DECISIONS.md`). REMAINING: an actual public release (tag/tap, sha256 bump) once H5 versioning
  lands — pipeline drafts carry the TODO markers.

---

## Track D — LSP / editor experience (`lsp/src/server.ts`)
*Mostly independent; benefits from Track A. AST nodes now carry source spans (Track G), unblocking
D1/D2.*

- ✅ **D0. Diagnostics on change.**
- ⬜ **D1. Hover types** (`stringifyType` exists; map a cursor to a symbol/expression via the new spans).
- ⬜ **D2. Go-to-definition / find-references** (needs symbol→span tracking — spans now exist).
- ⬜ **D3. Autocomplete** (scope-aware; structural members).
- ⬜ **D4. Formatter** (+ `vl fmt`).
- ⬜ **D5. Semantic tokens.**
- ⬜ **D6. Inlay hints** for inferred types — *the* feature for a "types are hidden" language.

---

## Track E — Browser playground + sandbox
*Depends on C1. The compiler is pure TS + binaryen (wasm), so it runs client-side.*

- ⬜ **E1. Bundle the compiler for the browser** (esbuild browser target).
- ⬜ **E2. Playground UI** — Monaco editor + output pane.
- ⬜ **E3. Sandboxed execution** — compiled user wasm in a Web Worker, fresh `Memory`, controlled
  `log` only, enforced limits. The wasm sandbox + worker isolation is the security boundary.
- ⬜ **E4. Shareable links** (encode source in URL / gist).

---

## Track F — Infrastructure & hygiene
*Independent; do continuously.*

- ✅ **F1. Test harness** (`deno task test` over the `.vl` corpus with `// @directive` expectations).
- ⬜ **F2. Gate debug `console.log`s** in `toWasm.ts` behind a debug flag.
- ✅ **F3. Retired `ts-interpreter/` → `reference/`.**
- ⬜ **F4. Re-enable inline `m.validate()`** during dev for earlier failure.
- ⬜ **F5. Settle the name** (VL vs Vital) and apply consistently.
- ⬜ **F6. Document the build** (`deno task build`/`test`; the antlr/gradle gen step is gone).
- ⬜ **F7. Fix the `paramater` misspelling** project-wide (optional; currently consistent).
- ✅ **F8. Dropped the binaryen patch + `patch-package`** (LSP server is ESM, where binaryen's TLA is
  legal). REMAINING (F5-adjacent): confirm vscode-languageclient forking the ESM server in VS Code.

---

## Track G — Hand-written parser ✅ DONE
Replaced antlr4 with a hand-written TS lexer + recursive-descent/Pratt parser that emits the typed
AST directly. antlr4, the gradle project, the generated dirs, and the `gen` task are gone; AST nodes
now carry source spans (`Context = { start, stop }`). This was the parser-side bootstrap gate (H1). →
`DECISIONS.md` for the hand-written-over-generator choice.

---

## Track H — Self-hosting & distribution (the bootstrap end-state)
*The goal: VL compiles itself; the TypeScript/Deno host (Deno, the TS compiler core, the already-gone
antlr/Java generator) retires; the compiler becomes VL→wasm on a generic wasm runtime. The `.vl`
corpus (A12) is the host-agnostic oracle — the same tests pass whichever compiler runs them.
**Distribution does NOT require self-hosting** (the two timelines below are independent).*

- 🟡 **H-M1. Distribute now via `deno compile` (= C5).** Native `vl` binary builds and runs with
  binaryen embedded (no flags) — see C5. ~187MB binary (V8 + TS compiler + binaryen). Decoupled from
  everything below; today's compiler unchanged. REMAINING == C5's: an actual published release.
- ✅ **H1. Parser self-hostable (= Track G).** The one piece that categorically can't live in a
  VL-in-VL compiler is gone.
- ⬜ **H2. Make VL expressive enough to write a compiler.** Recursive tree types (**A11 ✅**), generic
  collections (**A10**, **B6 tier-2** lists, **B6a** maps), string munging (**A7** methods). A10 +
  collections are the remaining gap — the capability bar for the port.
- ⬜ **H3. Port the compiler to VL.** Rewrite `toAST`/`typecheck`/`toWasm` as `.vl`, validated by
  running the corpus through the VL-written compiler. Incremental; TS and VL compilers cross-checked.
- ⬜ **H4. WASM emission — DECIDED: emit bytes directly + optional `wasm-opt`** (binaryen's npm build
  is JS-bound; → `DECISIONS.md`, incl. the Heap2Local caveat). binaryen stays for the TS compiler.
- ⬜ **H-M2. Wasm-native distribution (end-state).** The `vl` binary becomes a wasm runtime (wasmtime —
  full WasmGC since v27 / Wasm 3.0) + a small host shim that runs *both* the compiler-wasm and
  user-program-wasm. No V8, no binaryen, no Deno.
- ⬜ **H5. Versioning — deferred; rustup/Volta model, not nvm** (→ `DECISIONS.md`). Make the H-M1
  install path version-stamped so a launcher can slot in later.

**Sequence:** H-M1 (now) → H2 (A10 + collections) → H3 port → H-M2 host swap. Cost is dominated by
H2/H3; H1 done, H4 decided.

---

## Next (highest leverage)

- **A10 generics + collections (B6 tier-2 lists, B6a maps)** — the H2 capability bar, and the gate on
  self-hosting (H3). The deepest remaining type-system work.
- **C5 / H-M1** — `deno compile` + brew. Small, decoupled, ships the distribution story now.
- **D1/D2** — hover + go-to-def, now that AST nodes carry source spans.
- Smaller/independent: B6 growable lists, B13 callable-objects/index-traps, B17 lint pass, A6b Stage A.
