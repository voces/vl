# Silent-class inventory — a measured rebuild of the queue

Every row below was produced by generating a program, running it, and grading the **run
value** against an expectation computed independently of the compiler. Nothing here is
inherited from an earlier filing. Where an earlier filing is contradicted, the
contradiction is stated in "Not a defect".

The sweep is reproducible: `scripts/silent-sweep/gen.py` (main grid), `genorder.py`
(declaration-order grid), `sabotage.py` (grader proof), `sweep.sh` (bounded runner, four
concurrent `vl` invocations), `grade.py` (classifier), `counts.py` / `pivot.py` (tallies).

## 0. What was measured

| | |
|---|---|
| cells generated and run | **9,345** |
| result files | **9,345** (asserted `records == cells` on every run) |
| `vl` invocations per cell | 2 (`check` + `run`), plus a third (`build`) only when the run stage failed |
| concurrency | 4, never more |
| runtime inputs per cell | **2 — every cell** (a present value, and `null` or a non-matching variant) |
| evaluation-count oracle | a module-scope counter incremented in the producer, printed as the last line of **every** cell |

The producer is called exactly once by construction in every cell, so the trailing count
line is a hard oracle: any cell printing anything but `1` is a failing cell whatever its
values say.

### The outcome columns, kept strictly separate

| column | cells | / 9,345 |
|---|---|---|
| correct | 6,499 | 69.5% |
| **check-clean SILENTLY WRONG VALUE** | **2** | |
| **check-clean WRONG EVALUATION COUNT** | **4** | |
| **check-clean INVALID WASM** | **97** | |
| **TRAP (emitted program)** | **0** | |
| **COMPILER TRAP (check-clean, no diagnostic at all)** | **4** | |
| loud check reject | 1,361 | |
| loud emit reject | 1,378 | |
| hint-only rc 1 | 0 | |
| other runtime failure | 0 | |
| **SILENT TOTAL** | **107** | 1.14% |

`compiler_trap` is split out from `trap` because they are not the same event: a trap with
**no module written** is the compiler's own `array.get` going out of bounds while emitting,
which produces no diagnostic and no artefact. Merging it with a program trap would hide the
worse one. The split is measured, not guessed — the third `vl build` stage records the
output module's size.

`hint-only rc 1` is zero because on this tip `vl check` exits **0** on a file whose only
diagnostics are `[HINT]` / `[WARNING]` (measured: a `redundant type annotation` hint and an
`Unused variable` warning together still give rc 0, and `vl run` neither prints them nor
fails). The classifier keys on the presence of an `[ERROR]` line rather than on rc, so the
column exists and would fire; it simply never did.

### By position (all legs)

| const_local | 892 | 744 | 4 | 75 | 69 |

| mapget | 204 | 112 | **4** | 18 | 70 |
| bare | 45 | 42 | 0 | 3 | 0 |

**`capture` holds 90 of the 107 silent cells (84%) on 8.3% of the population.** That is the
single strongest signal in the sweep.

### By construct

| construct | cells | correct | silent | loud check | loud emit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| nenull (`if x != null`) | 1,442 | 978 | **36** | 168 | 260 |
| eqnull_else (`if x == null … else`) | 1,386 | 932 | **32** | 168 | 254 |
| is_t (`if x is T`) | 1,848 | 1,312 | **8** | 224 | 304 |
| match_null | 630 | 340 | 0 | 178 | 112 |
| andguard (`x != null && …`) | 198 | 188 | **10** | 0 | 0 |
| while_g (`while x != null && …`) | 462 | 348 | **10** | 22 | 82 |
| coalesce (`x ?? d`) | 828 | 546 | **2** | 18 | 262 |
| printdirect | 828 | 462 | 0 | 358 | 8 |
| eqnullcmp (`x == null`) | 504 | 439 | 0 | 23 | 42 |
| optchain (`const t = x?.p`) | 132 | **0** | 0 | 110 | 22 |
| direct | 652 | 588 | **6** | 42 | 16 |
| eqcmp | 216 | 208 | 0 | 2 | 6 |
| fwd (alias declared after its user) | 45 | **12** | **3** | 30 | 0 |
| ord (alias declared before its user) | 174 | 146 | 0 | 18 | 10 |

**Every silent cell in a narrowing construct is in a `null`-COMPARISON form**
(`!= null`, `== null`-else, `&&`-guard, `while`-guard). `is` contributes 8, all of them the
numeric-litunion box, and `match` contributes none. That is the shared root of §3.

### By runtime input, and by nullability

| axis | cells | correct | silent |
|---|---|---|---|
| input 0 (present value / matching variant) | 4,709 | 3,275 | 55 |
| input 1 (`null` / other variant) | 4,636 | 3,224 | 52 |
| plain (non-nullable) | 1,835 | 1,435 | 10 |
| nullable | 7,510 | 5,064 | 97 |

Both runtime inputs carry silent cells in near-equal share, which is the argument for the
requirement: **a one-input probe of this population would have found roughly half of it,
and would not have known which half it missed.**

## 2. Ranked live defects

Ranked silent-before-loud; within silent, wrong value → wrong evaluation count → invalid
wasm → trap; within a class, flat-across-many-reps before single-rep.

### D1 — a struct field whose type is an alias declared LATER in the file resolves to the wrong rep
**check-clean SILENTLY WRONG VALUE · 2 cells + 1 invalid wasm + 30 loud check rejects, of 45 in the `fwd` leg (12 correct)**

Repro (`boolean` payload — prints `1`, must print `true`):

    type Wrap = { f: Flag }
    type Flag = boolean
    const w: Wrap = { f: true }
    print(w.f)
    // vl check: rc 0, no diagnostic.  Output: 1        <- WRONG
    // with `{ f: false }` the output is 0

Control (the same program with the two declarations swapped — prints `true`):

    type Flag2 = boolean
    type Wrap2 = { f: Flag2 }
    const w: Wrap2 = { f: true }
    print(w.f)

Second silent spelling (litunion payload — prints the raw interned atom id `0`, must print
`p`):

    type Kc = "p" | "q"
    type WrapKc = { f: Kd }
    type Kd = Kc | null
    function body() {
      const w: WrapKc = { f: "p" }
      const v = w.f
      if v != null { print(v) } else { print("NUL") }
    }
    body()
    // vl check: rc 0.  Output: 0                       <- WRONG (control prints `p`)

Third spelling, same axis, worse verdict — **check-clean INVALID WASM**:

    type K = "p" | "q"
    type WrapK = { f: K2 }
    type K2 = K
    const w: WrapK = { f: "p" }
    print(w.f)
    // vl check rc 0; module written (763 bytes); engine rejects it

Fourth spelling, a **bogus diagnostic** on a legal program:

    type WrapCh = { f: Ch1 }
    type Ch1 = Ch2
    type Ch2 = boolean
    const w: WrapCh = { f: true }
    print(w.f)
    // [ERROR]: Type `Ch1` is `never` (an empty type — its operands have no common
    //          values), so it has no values

* **Triggered by**: input 0 (the present value). The `null` input takes the else arm and is
  correct, which is why a null-only probe of this shape reads clean.
* **Flat on**: the declaration-order axis — every `fwd` cell of a print-classified payload
  is wrong, every `ord` control is right.
* **Varies on**: the payload rep. `boolean` → wrong value (`1`/`0`); a litunion → wrong
  value (the atom id) or invalid wasm; `i32`, `i64`, `f64`, `f32`, `string`, a struct
  alias, a nested struct → **correct**, because their print IS the default classification.
* **Narrower than it looks, and the narrowing is the diagnosis**: the stored VALUE is
  right. `print(w.f) == true` prints `true` and `if w.f { … }` takes the right branch
  (measured) — only `print` of the field is wrong. So this is a *print-classifier* lookup
  against a table the forward reference has not populated, not a storage bug.
* **Reach**: the struct-FIELD container only. A forward alias as a list element, a map
  value, a bare binding, a param, or a return type is correct (all measured).
* **One root or several**: one. All four spellings are the same forward reference; the four
  different symptoms are four different consumers of the unresolved field type.

### D2 — `for x in <expr>.keys()` / `.values()` evaluates `<expr>` TWICE, and iterates the SECOND result
**check-clean WRONG EVALUATION COUNT · 4 cells of 4 reachable in the grid; confirmed on 8 further hand-written receivers**

Repro:

    let nCalls = 0
    function mk(): {[string]: i32} {
      nCalls = nCalls + 1
      const m: {[string]: i32} = Map()
      m["k"] = nCalls
      return m
    }
    for v in mk().values() { print(v) }
    print(nCalls)
    // vl check rc 0.  Output:  2 / 2      <- the value printed is from the SECOND map,
    //                                       and the count is 2, not 1

Control (bind the receiver first — one call, and the first map is the one iterated):

    const b = mk()
    for v in b.values() { print(v) }
    print(nCalls)
    // Output: 1 / 1

* **Triggered by**: both runtime inputs equally — this is not a null-dependent path.
* **Flat on**: the key rep (`{[string]: i32}` and `{[i32]: string}` both double); the
  method (`.keys()` and `.values()` both double); the receiver's shape — a call
  (`mk()`), a field of a call (`mk().m`), a call of a call (`idf(mk())`) all double; module
  scope and inside a function both double.
* **Varies on**: whether the receiver is a *place*. A local, a global and a parameter are
  each evaluated once. So the defect is "the receiver EXPRESSION is emitted twice", and a
  place is idempotent by luck rather than by design.
* **Not** `.size`, **not** `m["k"]`, **not** a plain list `for-in`, **not** `.slice`,
  **not** `.map`, **not** `.filter` — all measured at exactly one call.
* **Why this is worse than a doubled side effect**: `G4_identity` above shows the loop body
  reads the SECOND object. Any receiver whose two evaluations differ — a counter, a fresh
  `Map()`, a mutating builder, an allocation — iterates something the program never
  produced. This is one step from a silently-wrong value, and it is value-correct and
  check-clean today for exactly the reason #1441 was: the sibling receivers in the corpus
  have no side effect.
* **One root**: one — the for-in iterable lowering for the `keys`/`values` view emits its
  receiver once to obtain the view and once more to obtain the length/backing.

---

### D3 — a nullable SCALAR BOX captured by a nested function, narrowed with a `null` COMPARISON, emits invalid wasm
**check-clean INVALID WASM · 86 cells, the largest silent family**

Repro:

    function body(p: i32 | null) {
      function inner() { if p != null { print(p) } else { print("N") } }
      inner()
    }
    body(7)
    body(null)
    // vl check: rc 0, "Checked 1 file, no errors."
    // vl run:   Invalid input WebAssembly code at offset 370:
    //           type mismatch: expected i32, found (ref $type)   [in function `inner`]
    // wasm-tools validate agrees: "func 6 failed to validate"

Control (the identical read, not captured — correct on both inputs):

    function body(p: i32 | null) {
      if p != null { print(p) } else { print("N") }
    }
    body(7)
    body(null)

Second control (the same capture with a niche payload instead of a box — correct):

    function body(p: string | null) {
      function inner() { if p != null { print(p) } else { print("N") } }
      inner()
    }

* **Triggered by**: both inputs — the module fails to validate, so neither input runs.
* **Flat on**: five payload reps (`i32 | null`, `i64 | null`, `f64 | null`, `f32 | null`,
  `(1 | 2) | null`), 16 cells each except the numeric litunion at 22; the inline and the
  declared-ALIAS spelling of the nullable both; a named nested function and a `=>` lambda
  both; one and two levels of nesting both.
* **Varies on the NARROWING FORM, and this is the whole finding**:

  | narrow form at a capture | verdict |
  |---|---|
  | `if p != null` | **check-clean INVALID WASM** |
  | `if p == null { … } else` | **check-clean INVALID WASM** |
  | `p != null && p == 7` | **check-clean INVALID WASM** |
  | `while p != null && …` | **check-clean INVALID WASM** |
  | `if p is i32` | loud: `emitProgram: narrowed union binding is not a local or global` |
  | `match p { null => … _ => … }` | loud: same |
  | `p ?? 0` | loud: same |
  | `print(p == null)` (no narrowing) | correct |

* **The complete capture-position map over all eleven nullable niches** (nullable leg, 780
  cells at this position):

  | payload | capture verdict |
  |---|---|
  | `string \| null` (nulstr) | correct (38/38) |
  | `boolean \| null` (nulbool) | correct (38/38) |
  | `S \| null` (nulstruct) | correct (24/26) |
  | `i32[] \| null` (nullist) | correct (24/26) |
  | `string[] \| null` (nulstrlist) | loud emit — `bare null needs a struct-typed context` |
  | `f64[] \| null` (nulf64list) | loud emit — same |
  | `i64[] \| null` (nuli64list) | loud emit — same |
  | `f32[] \| null` (nulf32list) | loud emit — same |
  | `S[] \| null` (nulreflist) | loud emit — `ref valtype with no interned shape` |
  | `((i32) => i32) \| null` (nulclosure) | loud emit — `bare null needs a struct-typed context` |
  | `{[string]: i32} \| null` (nulmap) | loud emit — same |
  | `i32/i64/f64/f32 \| null` (scalar BOX) | **check-clean INVALID WASM** |
  | `(1 \| 2) \| null` (numeric-litunion box) | **check-clean INVALID WASM** |
  | `(string \| i32) \| null` (value-union box) | loud emit — `narrowed union binding is not a local or global` |

* **One root**: one, and the source says so in the wrong direction. `emitUnionBoxPush`
  (`compiler/wasmEmit.vl:3123`) carries the floor and a comment asserting *"a clean reject,
  **not invalid wasm**"*. That assertion holds only for the readers that route through
  `emitUnionBoxPush` — `is`, `match`, `??`. A `null`-comparison narrow of a nullable scalar
  box reaches the read through a different classifier that never asks, so it emits an
  unboxed i32 read against a `(ref $type)` slot. **The floor exists and four of its seven
  callers do not stand on it.** The `(string | i32)` box is loud because its narrowed read
  DOES route through `emitUnionBoxPush` in every form.

---

### D4 — an i32-keyed map captured by a nested function TRAPS INSIDE THE COMPILER
**COMPILER TRAP · 4 cells · check-clean, no diagnostic, no module**

Repro:

    function mk(): {[i32]: string} {
      const m: {[i32]: string} = Map()
      m[1] = "x"
      return m
    }
    function body(m: {[i32]: string}) {
      function inner() { print(m.size) }
      inner()
    }
    body(mk())
    // vl check: "Checked 1 file, no errors."
    // vl run / vl build:  wasm trap: out of bounds array access
    //                     note: an index outside the bounds of an array.
    // No module is written.  The backtrace is 13 frames of the COMPILER's own wasm
    // (function 1416 .. 2794), not the program's.

Control (a string-keyed map in the same shape — correct):

    function body(m: {[string]: i32}) {
      function inner2() { print(m.size) }
      inner2()
    }

Second control (an i32-keyed map read WITHOUT the capture — correct).

* **Triggered by**: both inputs; there is no runtime, so the input is irrelevant.
* **Flat on**: the capture being a parameter or a local (both trap).
* **Varies on**: the map's KEY rep only. String-keyed is clean at the same position.
* **Why it ranks above the remaining invalid-wasm rows**: it is the only outcome in the
  whole sweep with **no diagnostic of any kind** — not a reject, not a bad module, just an
  out-of-bounds `array.get` in the compiler. Everything else at least produces a message or
  an artefact a reader can inspect. There is a nearby loud floor for this rep
  (`emitProgram: an i32-keyed Map/Set is supported as a binding / parameter / return /
  '| null' / an ARRAY element…`, 34 cells elsewhere in the sweep) — the capture storage
  class simply reaches an indexed table before that floor is consulted.

---

### D5 — a NARROWED nullable map iterated by `.values()` / `.keys()` emits invalid wasm
**check-clean INVALID WASM · 4 cells**

Repro:

    function mk(): {[string]: i32} | null {
      const m: {[string]: i32} = Map()
      m["k"] = 5
      return m
    }
    function body() {
      const v: {[string]: i32} | null = mk()
      if v != null { for z in v.values() { print(z) } } else { print("N") }
    }
    body()
    // vl check rc 0; module written (2030 bytes); engine rejects it

Control (`.size` on the same narrowed binding — correct):

    if v != null { print(v.size) } else { print("N") }

Second control (the non-nullable map, same loop — correct).

* **Triggered by**: input 0. The `null` input takes the else arm; but the module fails to
  validate, so neither input produces output.
* **Flat on**: `.values()` and `.keys()` both (2030 / 2060 bytes); both key reps.
* **Varies on**: the narrowing. The un-narrowed non-nullable map is fine.
* **Shares a root with D2** (see §3): both are the map view's for-in lowering failing to
  read the receiver through the recovered non-null temp.

---

### D6 — a NUMERIC-LITUNION map value, read by index and narrowed, emits invalid wasm
**check-clean INVALID WASM · 4 cells of 12 in the `mapget` × numlit grid**

Repro:

    type N2 = 1 | 2
    function body() {
      const m: {[string]: N2} = Map()
      m["k"] = 1
      const v = m["k"]
      if v != null { print(v) } else { print("N") }
    }
    body()
    // vl check rc 0; module written (1996 bytes); engine rejects with
    //   type mismatch: expected (ref null $type), found i32

Controls (both correct): the string-litunion value type `{[string]: K}`; and the
DECLARED-nullable value type `{[string]: N2 | null}`.

* **Triggered by**: both inputs (present key and missing key) — validation fails first.
* **Flat on**: the `!= null` and `== null`-else narrow forms.
* **Varies on**: the value rep. `i32`/`i64`/`f64`/`f32` value types give a LOUD reject at
  the identical position (D11 below); the numeric litunion is the one that gets a bad
  module instead.

---

### D7 — `xs[0] ?? d` over a nullable-ELEMENT list emits invalid wasm
**check-clean INVALID WASM · 2 cells · already documented as a residue, still live**

Repro:

    function body() {
      const xs: (string | null)[] = ["aa", null]
      print(xs[0] ?? "DD")
    }
    body()
    // vl check rc 0; module written (1042 bytes); engine rejects with
    //   type mismatch: expected (ref $type), found (ref null $type)

Control (bind the element, then coalesce — correct on both elements):

    const a = xs[0]
    print(a ?? "DD")

Second control: `??` on a map index get (`m["k"] ?? "DD"`) — correct.

* This is the cell `per-rep-ladder-audit.md` C4 already names: *"`??` over a LIST index …
  check-clean INVALID WASM for the `(string | null)[]` control (1 cell), which is the worse
  verdict and is pre-existing."* Re-measured here at 2 cells (both inputs) and unchanged.
  Recorded so it is not re-derived a third time.

---

### D8 — assigning `null` to a nullable binding INSIDE the block where it is narrowed non-null is rejected
**loud check reject · flat across every place**

Repro:

    function body(p: string | null) {
      let q: string | null = p
      if q != null { print(q)
        q = null }
      print(q == null)
    }
    body("a")
    // [ERROR]: cannot assign null to string

Control (assign after the narrowed block — correct, prints `a` / `true`):

    if q != null { print(q) }
    q = null
    print(q == null)

* **Flat on**: `let`, param, struct field (`w.f = null`), module global — all four reject;
  and on both `if x != null { … }` and `if x == null { … } else { … }`.
* **Varies on**: the assigned value. `q = "zz"` inside the narrowed block is accepted, so
  the check is against the FLOW-NARROWED type rather than the declared one.
* **Why it is worth a slice**: it makes the ordinary drain idiom unwritable —

      while q != null { print(q)
        q = null }        // [ERROR]: cannot assign null to string

  there is no rewriting of that loop that keeps the guard and clears the variable, so the
  shape has to be replaced with a counter. Assignment should be checked against the
  binding's DECLARED type; narrowing constrains reads, not writes.

### D9 — a nullable-niche list / map / closure captured by a nested function is a loud emit reject
**loud emit reject · 124 cells at the capture position**

Repro:

    function body(p: string[] | null) {
      function inner() { if p != null { print(p.length) } else { print("N") } }
      inner()
    }
    body(["a"])
    body(null)
    // vl check rc 0; vl run: emitProgram: bare null needs a struct-typed context

Controls (both correct): the same capture with `i32[] | null`; and the same read
uncaptured.

* **Flat on**: `string[] | null`, `f64[] | null`, `i64[] | null`, `f32[] | null`,
  `{[string]: i32} | null`, `((i32) => i32) | null` — all `bare null needs a struct-typed
  context`. `S[] | null` gives `ref valtype with no interned shape`; **different message,
  same root** (see §3).
* This is audit row R10's last bullet reached with a program: *"`exprNulScalarListKind`'s
  Ident arm covers param / declared local / global but **not the CAPTURE storage class**"*.
  It is now measured: 6 of the 11 niches fail at that storage class and 4 succeed, and the
  two that succeed (`nulstr`, `nulbool`, plus `nulstruct` and `nullist`) are exactly the
  four the audit says get remembered.

### D10 — a numeric-valued map read by index and narrowed is a loud emit reject
**loud emit reject · 40 cells at the `mapget` position across the four numeric value reps**

Repro:

    function body() {
      const m: {[string]: i32} = Map()
      m["k"] = 5
      const v = m["k"]
      if v != null { print(v) } else { print("N") }
    }
    body()
    // vl check rc 0; vl run: emitProgram: bare null needs a struct-typed context

Controls, all correct: `{[string]: boolean}`; `{[string]: string}`;
`{[string]: i32 | null}` (the DECLARED-nullable value type); `print(m["k"] ?? 0)`;
`for p in m.values()`.

* **Flat on**: `i32`, `i64`, `f64`, `f32` value types. Also `"p" | "q"` spelled INLINE as a
  map value type.
* **Varies on**: whether the map's value type is declared nullable. It is the map read's
  *implicit* `T?` that has no rep, not `T | null` itself.
* **The 40 cells carry THREE different messages for one axis**: 16 report `bare null needs a
  struct-typed context` (the `!= null` / `== null`-else forms), 16 report
  `emitProgram: 'is' test but no union type declared` (the `is` form), and 8 report
  `` `??` is only supported on a map index get`` — which is the "same root, different
  message" case in §3, inside a single row.
* **This is the axis-correction the orchestrator asked for.** The earlier filing retired
  "map-value reads with `is` and `!= null`" as working, and it IS working for `boolean` and
  for `K | null` values. The live half is the numeric value type, which the earlier probe
  did not carry.

---

### D11 — a nullable STRUCT UNION narrowed twice (`!= null`, then `is Variant`) is a loud emit reject
**loud emit reject · 158 cells carry this message**

Repro:

    type Cat = { c: i32 }
    type Dog = { d: i32 }
    type Shape = Cat | Dog
    function body(s: Shape | null) {
      if s != null { if s is Cat { print(s.c) } else { print(s.d) } } else { print("N") }
    }
    body({ c: 1 })
    body(null)
    // vl check rc 0; vl run: emitProgram: narrowed receiver names no union variant

Control — do the `is` test DIRECTLY on the nullable, which also handles `null` correctly:

    function body(s: Shape | null) {
      if s is Cat { print(s.c) } else { print("OTHER") }
    }
    body({ c: 1 })   // 1
    body(null)       // OTHER

* **Flat on**: every position (11 of 11) and on the `match s { null => … _ => … }` spelling
  of the outer narrow.
* **Varies on**: whether the outer `null` narrow is present. Removing it fixes it — so the
  defect is that the FIRST narrow replaces the receiver with a temp the variant lookup
  cannot name.

---

### D12 — binding an optional-chain result to a `const` is a loud emit reject, with a message about `return`
**loud emit reject · 22 cells · 0 of 132 `optchain` cells correct**

Repro:

    type S = { w: i32 }
    function body(a: S | null) {
      const t = a?.w
      print(t ?? 0)
    }
    body({ w: 3 })
    body(null)
    // vl check rc 0; vl run: emitProgram: unsupported expression in return

Controls, all correct: `print(a?.w ?? 0)` (no intermediate binding); `if a?.w != null { … }`;
`if a != null { print(a.w) }`.

* The message names `return`, and there is no `return` in the program. The reported
  position is the function's own header line.
* The neighbouring 100 cells in the same construct are a separate, LOUD, arguably-by-design
  family (110 cells): `?.length` / `?.size` on a nullable list, string or map is
  `[ERROR]: member access '?.length' on non-object i32[]?`. The message calls `i32[]?` a
  non-object, which is misleading, but the decline itself is consistent (only struct fields
  are reachable through `?.`). Filed as a message defect, not a capability defect.

---

### D13 — an INLINE literal union produced by a CALL and stored in a list or map is a loud emit reject
**loud emit reject · 40 cells**

Repro:

    function src(): "p" | "q" { return "p" }
    function body() {
      const xs: ("p" | "q")[] = [src()]
      print(xs[0])
    }
    body()
    // vl check rc 0; vl run:
    //   emitProgram: literal-union atom narrowing needs a re-readable receiver

Controls, all correct: the same list from a LITERAL (`["p"]`); the same call through a
NAMED alias (`type K = "p" | "q"` … `const xs: K[] = [src2()]`); the same call into a plain
`string[]`; the same call into a bare `const v: "p" | "q" = src4()`.

* **Flat on**: the list-element and map-value containers.
* **Varies on**: named vs inline (named is clean), and literal vs call initialiser (literal
  is clean). It needs BOTH the inline spelling and the call.

---

### D14 — `f32[] | null` (audit row R2) is still loud at every operation
**loud emit reject · 140 cells carry `field access but no struct type declared`; list_f32 is 240 loud-emit cells of 340**

Repro:

    function mk(): f32[] | null { return [1.25] }
    function body() {
      const w: f32[] | null = mk()
      if w != null { print(w.length) } else { print("N") }
    }
    body()
    // vl check rc 0; vl run: emitProgram: field access but no struct type declared

Controls, both correct: the `f64[] | null` twin; the non-nullable `f32[]`.

* Re-measured, unchanged from the audit's R2. Recorded with a fresh count so the next
  reader does not re-derive it: `list_f32` is the worst-served rep in the sweep, 76 correct
  of 340.

---

### D15 — `??` applied to a NON-nullable value reports a map-index rule
**loud emit reject · 224 cells carry this message**

Repro:

    function mk(): i32 { return 7 }
    print(mk() ?? 0)
    // vl check rc 0; vl run: emitProgram: `??` is only supported on a map index get

Control: make the operand nullable (`function mk2(): i32 | null`) — correct.

* A useless `??` is a lint-level fact the checker should state at check time; instead it
  survives to emit and reports a rule about map index gets, which is not the reason. This
  is the single most common loud message in the sweep and most of its firings are of this
  shape, so it is worth correcting for the diagnostic alone.

---

## 3. Shared-root analysis

### Root A — one floor, seven callers, four of which do not stand on it
**D3** (silent invalid wasm) and the loud `narrowed union binding is not a local or global`
family are the SAME decision site: `emitUnionBoxPush`, `compiler/wasmEmit.vl:3123`. Its
comment states the invariant it means to hold — *"a clean reject, not invalid wasm"* — and
the measurement says the invariant holds for three of the seven narrowing forms that reach
a captured box read (`is`, `match`, `??`) and fails for four (`!= null`, `== null`-else,
`&&`-guard, `while`-guard). The `null`-comparison forms narrow through a different
classifier that never consults the box path at all. **This is the highest-value grouping in
the inventory: one predicate away from turning 86 silent cells into 86 loud ones**, which is
strictly better even before anyone wires the capture.

Evidence that it is one root and not two: the loud and the silent forms are the same
program with one operator changed, on the same binding, at the same position, for the same
five reps; and the rep that is loud in ALL seven forms (`(string | i32) | null`) is exactly
the rep whose narrowed read has no second path.

### Root B — the map-view for-in lowering reads its receiver twice
**D2** (double evaluation) and **D5** (narrowed nullable map → invalid wasm) are the same
lowering. D2 shows the receiver expression is emitted twice; D5 shows that when the
receiver is a RECOVERED non-null temp, the second emission does not see the recover and
pushes the nullable wrapper. A single-emission receiver temp closes both. Both are specific
to `.keys()` / `.values()`: `.size`, index get, `.slice`, `.map`, `.filter` and a plain
list `for-in` are all correct at one evaluation (measured), so the shared site is the view
iterable, not for-in generally.

This grouping is the one to be most careful about, because the two rows have **no message
in common** — one has no message at all. They were grouped by the receiver-shape axis, not
by text.

### Root C — the forward reference, four consumers
**D1**'s four symptoms — a boolean printing `1`, a litunion printing its atom id, invalid
wasm, and `Type Ch1 is never` — are one unresolved field type read by four different
consumers (the print classifier, the atom widener, the emitter's field rep, the
never-folding check). The tell that it is one root is that swapping two declaration lines
fixes all four, and that the reps whose print is the DEFAULT classification are unaffected.

The `cannot assign {f: i32?} to 'w' of type {f: i32?}` message — a type reported as not
assignable to a type rendered identically — is the fifth consumer, the assignability check,
reached when the forward alias also carries `| null`. It is **158 cells**, and every one of
them is at (alias spelling, struct-field position), which is precisely the forward-declaration
axis: independent confirmation that Root C and this message are one site.

### Root D — "bare null needs a struct-typed context" is a GENERIC FALLTHROUGH and must not be used to group
192 cells carry that message across at least **three unrelated axes**: the capture storage
class (D9), the map-index-read nullable (D10), and a nullable-niche map VALUE type. They are
grouped here as three separate rows on purpose. Conversely `S[] | null` at a capture reports
`ref valtype with no interned shape` — a DIFFERENT message inside D9's single axis. Message
identity and root identity are independent in this compiler, in both directions, and the
sweep shows both directions in the same table.

### Root E — the map-index read's implicit `T?` has no rep for the numeric reps
**D6** (invalid wasm, numeric litunion) and **D10** (loud, `i32`/`i64`/`f64`/`f32`) are one
site with two severities. The evidence is the shared control: declaring the map's value type
as `T | null` fixes both, and `??`/`.values()` on the same map are correct in both. So the
defect is not the numeric rep and not the narrowing — it is that the type the index read
SYNTHESISES is not the type `T | null` interns to.

### Not shared, though it looks it
`f32[] | null` (D14) is NOT part of Root A or D despite also being a nullable niche: its
failure is in the typed-IR read path (`exprF32Array`, audit R2) and it fails at every
position including the ones where the other niches are clean. Filed separately.

## 4. NOT A DEFECT

Everything in this section was probed on this tip and behaves correctly, is a documented
deliberate decline, or was **my own probe error**. It is here so no agent is spent on it.

### 4a. The orchestrator's stale list — every item confirmed WORKING

| shape | probe | result |
|---|---|---|
| a value-union box as a for-in LOOP VAR, narrowed by `is` | `for v in xs { if v is string … }` over `(string \| i32)[]` | `aa` / `7` — correct |
| `1 \| 2 \| null` with `if p != null` | `type N3 = 1 \| 2` ; param `N3 \| null` | `1` / `2` / `N` — correct |
| `.map`/`.filter` over `i32[] \| null`, and `boolean \| null` / `f64 \| null` reads | narrowed then `.map`, `.filter` | `2/2/true/1.25` and four `N` — correct |
| a litunion ATOM captured by a nested function, no narrowing | `type K4 = "p" \| "q"` ; capture `k` ; `print(k)` | `p` / `q` — correct |
| `let` + null initialiser + later `p = null` | `let p: string \| null = null` … `p = "aa"` … `p = null` | `true`/`aa`/`true` — correct |
| `mapkeys` over `boolean \| null` and `i32 \| null` map values | `for k in m.keys()` | `k`/`j`/`a` — correct |
| map-value reads with `is` and `!= null` | `{[string]: K \| null}` | `p`/`p` — correct **for this value rep**; see D10 for the numeric value rep, which is the live half |
| `exprIsF32` / `exprIsBool` member-union reads | `{a: f32, b: boolean}` reads | `true`/`true` — correct |

### 4b. Audit row R1 no longer reproduces
`per-rep-ladder-audit.md` R1 is filed as *"a DECLARED alias over a nullable niche … check-clean
INVALID WASM"* with this reaching program:

    type B = boolean | null
    const xs: B[] = [true, null]
    const a = xs[0]
    if a == null { print("N") } else { print(a) }

On this tip it prints `true` — **rc 0, correct, identical to the inline control**. The
alias-vs-inline axis was then measured properly (Leg E, 2,916 cells, 15 reps × 2 spellings ×
9 positions × 5 constructs × 2 inputs): the alias spelling has the **same** silent cell set
as inline (invalid wasm 4 vs 4 per numeric rep, 6 vs 6 for the numeric litunion) and **zero**
silent cells the inline spelling does not also have. What remains of R1 is LOUD: the alias
spelling loses 40–58 cells per construct to check rejects the inline spelling accepts, and
its most striking spelling is the forward-declaration case now filed as D1. **R1 as filed —
a silent alias/inline divergence — is closed; do not brief it.**

### 4c. Deliberate declines, confirmed by reading the message
* `print` of an un-narrowed nullable REF or numeric box — `print of {w: i32}? is type-valid
  but not yet supported by codegen — print the elements/fields individually`, and
  `print of a union value (i32?) … narrow it first`. Documented, helpful, and correct.
  470 cells of the sweep's loud check rejects are this.
* `print` of `string | null`, `boolean | null`, `K | null` **does** work and prints `null` —
  consistent with audit C4, and not to be confused with the above.
* `match` over a literal union — `match over a union with literal members is not supported —
  compare them with '==' in an if-chain`. 90 cells. Deliberate, names the fix.
* `?.length` / `?.size` on a nullable list/string/map — declines because `?.` reaches struct
  fields only. The message's "non-object" wording is filed under D12; the decline is not a
  defect.
* An i32-keyed Map/Set outside its supported positions — `emitProgram: an i32-keyed Map/Set
  is supported as a binding / parameter / return / '| null' / an ARRAY element`. A floor that
  names its own domain. (Its gap is the capture storage class, filed as D4.)

### 4d. MY OWN PROBE ERRORS — 136 cells of the sweep, excluded from every defect count
* **A nullable CLOSURE alias needs parentheses and my generator omitted them.**
  `type A = (i32) => i32 | null` parses as *a function returning `i32 | null`*, so 54 cells
  reported `return type mismatch: expected (i32) -> i32?, got null` and
  `cannot compare (i32) -> i32? with null`. The parenthesised form
  `type F = ((i32) => i32) | null` is **correct** (`print(src() == null)` → `true`;
  `if f != null { print(f(3)) }` → `4`). Had I filed the 54 cells I would have filed the
  parser's correct behaviour as a defect.
* **A nested `is Cat` inside `is Cat`.** My plain-leg `is_t` construct wrapped a read that
  was itself an `is` chain, making the inner else arm unreachable and correctly typed `Cat`;
  82 cells reported `no field 'd' on {c: i32}`. That is the checker being right.
* **A union rep's second value legitimately fails the `is` arm.** My first grader expected
  the read output where the else arm was correct, producing 10 false `wrong_value` cells for
  `vubox`. Fixed by recording, per rep, which value indices satisfy the `is` base; the
  count went to 0 and the four real silent columns were unaffected.
* Type declarations inside a function body are not statements
  (`emitProgram: unsupported statement in body`) — a probe error, not a defect.
* `.entries()` does not exist on a map (`unknown property 'entries'`) — a probe error.

### 4e. Cosmetic, recorded without a slice
A `T | null` map VALUE type read by index renders as `T??` in diagnostics
(`print of a union value (i32??) …`) rather than collapsing to `T?`. One `!= null` narrows it
correctly and the value is right, so this is a rendering/idempotence nit, not a behaviour
defect. 90 cells show the doubled render.

## 5. Grader discipline — what was proven, and how

### Sabotage, with the counts predicted before the run
30 cells were injected whose outcome is known by construction. The prediction was stated
before running and every leg hit exactly:

| injected | predicted | measured |
|---|---|---|
| programs printing a value the manifest does not expect | 12 `wrong_value` | **12** |
| programs whose callee runs twice, value lines still correct | 8 `wrong_evalcount` | **8** |
| programs with a list index out of bounds | 6 `trap` | **6** |
| clean controls that must not move | 4 `correct` | **4** |

So the two columns that read ZERO on the live population — `wrong_value` outside D1, and
`trap` — are zero because the population is clean there, not because the column is dead.

### The fourth silent column was proven against an independent validator
`invalid_wasm` fires 97 times on the live population, and one instance was checked outside
the harness:

    vl build … -o c00254.wasm
      -> "not a valid WebAssembly module — it was written, but it cannot instantiate
          (this is a compiler emit bug)"
    wasm-tools validate --features all c00254.wasm
      -> "error: func 6 failed to validate … type mismatch: expected i32, found (ref $type)"

`compiler_trap` fires 4 times and was separated from `trap` by a measurement, not a guess:
the third `vl build` stage records whether a module was written (0 bytes → the compiler
trapped; >0 bytes → the program trapped).

### Structural guarantees
* **One result file per cell.** `runcell.sh` writes `<cell>.res` and never appends to a
  shared file, so nothing can tear under `-P4`.
* **`records == cells` asserted on every run** — printed by `grade.py` as
  `cells=9126 result_files=9126 MATCH=OK` and `cells=219 result_files=219 MATCH=OK`.
* **Graded on the run value, never the build verdict.** D1's boolean cell is check-clean,
  run-clean, rc 0 — a build-verdict grader scores it a pass. It is the top row here.
* **Not a dead grader.** The 9,345 cells spread over 6 outcome columns with 21 distinct
  representations contributing and 17 positions contributing; the largest single column is
  69.5%, not 100%.
* **Harness-suspicion rule.** Any (position, construct) pair failing identically across ALL
  reps and both inputs was read by hand before being filed. That rule is what caught all
  five items in §4d — the `optchain` construct's 0-of-132 and the closure-alias 54 both
  tripped it.

## 6. Coverage gaps — axes not built, and why

Stated plainly rather than reported as a silent zero.

* **Sets** (string-key and i32-key) — not built. The rep vocabulary in the audit lists them
  as reps a ladder must answer for, and the i32-keyed map defect (D4) suggests the i32-keyed
  SET is worth the same probe. No syntax for a set literal was located in the time budget.
* **Newtypes / brands** (`type EntityId = new i32`) — not built. Given D1, the interaction
  worth measuring is a `new` alias declared AFTER its user.
* **Nested arrays** (`i32[][]`) — not built beyond audit R7's existing note.
* **Generics / monomorphised positions** — not built. Audit R8 (`monoArgTyName` has no
  `nulmap` arm) has a reaching program already and was not re-derived here.
* **`flat` records** — not built.
* **A nullable CLOSURE as an ALIAS inside the generated grid** — generated with a parse
  error (§4d) and therefore NOT measured by the grid. It was measured by hand instead
  (correct), so the gap is in the grid's coverage, not in the finding.
* **Multi-module / import positions** — every cell is a single file.
* **`-O` / `wasm-opt` output** — every cell was graded on the unoptimised module. A silent
  defect that only appears after `wasm-opt` would not be visible here.
* **Struct-field ASSIGNMENT** as a position (`w.f = src()`) — only field *construction* and
  field *read* were built. D8's field leg shows assignment is a distinct axis with its own
  behaviour, so this is a real gap.
* **Deeper capture chains** — two levels were probed by hand (invalid wasm, consistent with
  D3); three or more were not.
* **Evaluation counts under `is` / `match` / place-narrowing constructs** — these mention the
  access expression more than once by construction, so their expected count is not 1 and they
  were graded for value only. A double evaluation *within* one syntactic mention of an `is`
  arm would not be caught. Given D2, this is the gap most likely to hold another
  wrong-evaluation-count cell.

## 7. Where the population disagrees with the audit's score

`per-rep-ladder-audit.md` records "check-clean SILENTLY WRONG output, reached: 0 + 26 (C4),
all closed" and states plainly that the 0 is its own scans' blind spot. This sweep is a
different population — programs by rep × position × construct × input, rather than ladders
by scan shape — and it finds **2 silently-wrong-value cells and 4 wrong-evaluation-count
cells** that no ladder scan would reach:

* D1's root is a declaration-ORDER dependency. No per-rep ladder is incomplete; the ladder is
  consulted before its table is populated. A scan for missing arms cannot see it.
* D2's root is an expression emitted twice. There is no rep, no arm and no fallthrough
  involved, and the cell is value-correct — only a side-effect counter distinguishes it.

Both are arguments for keeping the program-population sweep alongside the ladder audit
rather than in place of it.
