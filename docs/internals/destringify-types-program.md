# Destringify types — program plan

Status: **IN PROGRESS.** Started 2026-07-24. Supersedes the ad-hoc "rep adoption" slices
(#1009–#1077), which destringified type *resolution*; this program destringifies type
*representation*.

## Terminal condition (checkable, not aspirational)

> No type-name string is used as a **key** or to make a **structural decision**.
> Strings survive only for (a) human-facing rendering — diagnostics, hover, `--json`; and
> (b) genuine **nominal identity** lookup, i.e. a declared name → its arena type.

Everything else keys on an arena type index (`T.tys`) or on `repCanonKey`.

Two consequences worth stating, because they are the ones people get wrong:

- `tyToStr` is **not** a target. 160 uses, almost all diagnostics. It stays.
- `structIndexByName("Cat")` is **not** a target. A declared name *is* the identity; that
  lookup is correct by construction. The target is only where a type's *structure* is
  re-derived from a rendering.

## Why this is worth doing (the evidence)

Every bug family this codebase has fought for months is one defect wearing different hats:
a type gets rendered to text, the text is compared or used as a key, and two structurally
identical types render differently (or two different types render the same).

- `$fnsig` twin functypes — three producers must agree character-for-character; when they
  don't, iso-recursively distinct types and a runtime cast failure.
- The same-fieldset twin family (#978/#996/#1041 and every `shapeFieldTypeCompat`
  refutation arm accreted to patch it) — all retired once resolution went structural.
- #1069: `emitIs` compared `#anon0` against `{foo:string}` with `==` and silently answered
  NO. **Outside** the resolver layer entirely — proof the disease is not confined to the
  area we had been working.

## The current state, measured

`slotCanonKey` is the tell — the function at the heart of every arena-based fix:

```vl
function slotCanonKey(si: i32): string {
  const nm = sNames[si]              // a STRING
  let di = cUserTypes[nm] ?? -1      // parse it back into a type
  ...
  return repCanonKey(di)             // ...then compute the structural key
}
```

The table is a table of *names*; the arena is a resolver layered over it. Resolution is
structural, storage is not.

Type-name-keyed tables (12 of the 34 `string[]` tables in `emit_state`):

| table | refs | layer |
|---|---|---|
| `sNames` | 93 | struct rows |
| `rlElemName` | 84 | ref-list slots |
| `mvValName` | 49 | map-value slots |
| `uVariants` | 49 | union variants |
| `sFieldElemName` | 39 | struct field element types |
| `unNames` | 38 | union names |
| `uFieldElemName` | 25 | variant field element types |
| `cloSigKeys` | 24 | `$fnsig` keys |
| `fRetRArrElem` | 20 | fn return ref-array element |
| `unMemberSet` | 17 | union member sets |
| `sAnonCanon` | 12 | anon-row canon keys |
| `gaeBases` / `gaeParams` | 14 | generic-alias expansion |

## Phases

Each phase is run-diff gated (#1019 discipline: byte-identity is not the gate once
behaviour can change), and each ships independently.

### D0 — arena-index sidecars (foundation, byte-identical, no consumer)

Record, at **intern time**, the arena type index each row denotes:
`sTyIx[]` ∥ `sNames`, `rlElemTyIx[]` ∥ `rlElemName`, `mvValTyIx[]` ∥ `mvValName`,
`unTyIx[]` ∥ `unNames`.

At intern time the minting node is in scope, so this **also covers the rows whose name does
not resolve** — the `#anon` literal rows that `slotCanonKey` currently falls back to
`sAnonCanon` for. Unconsumed → byte-identical. Mirrors #1009 (`nodeRepTyIx`) and #1022
(`sAnonCanon`), both of which shipped byte-identical and then unlocked their consumers.

### D1 — `slotCanonKey` reads the sidecar — SHIPPED, and the plan above was wrong

Landed as: the sidecar owns the rows **a name cannot resolve** (the `#anon` literal shapes),
and `sAnonCanon` is deleted. `slotCanonKey` no longer consults any key-string table.

**The sketch above — "becomes `repCanonKey(sTyIx[si])`", i.e. authoritative over the whole
function — is refuted.** Ahead of the name path it fails 5 suite cases (nullable-struct list
fields, variant reflist fields). The recorded index is the type as of **intern** time; the
name path re-resolves at **query** time; and for name-resolvable rows those disagree once the
arena mutates (`holeMemberTy` grows a hole's shape in place and bumps `tyMutEpoch`). This is
the same shape as the phase-0 probe's 141 benign divergences — a recorded arena type and a
resolver's answer are **not interchangeable by default**.

**Consequence for the later phases, which assumed otherwise:** an arena-index key is only a
drop-in replacement for a name key where the type cannot mutate after recording. Before D2/D3
make an index authoritative, either (a) re-record on mutation, (b) record a *canon key* rather
than an index where the value must be stable, or (c) prove the family is mutation-free. Pick
one deliberately per slice; do not assume.

### D2 — the computed-name interning layer

`rlInternName` / `rlSlotByName` / `mvCanonValName` mint a canonical name by string surgery
(`rlCanonLitUnionAtoms`, `rlCanonElemName`, litunion→`string` widening) and then key a slot
on the resulting text. Every one of those canonicalisations exists to make two spellings of
one *rep* collide — which is exactly `repCanonKey`'s job. Re-key the slot tables on the
canon key (or the arena index under `structFieldCodesEq`), and the canonicalisation helpers
delete themselves.

### D3 — the `$fnsig` layer (highest risk, highest value)

`cloSigKeyExt` / `annSigKey` / `cloSigKeys`. Three producers must agree on the key text; the
`repSigSlotTokOfKind`→`repStructSlotRep` canon (#1019) already fixed the slot-digit half.
Re-key on the arena signature. **ABI-affecting** — run-diff, not byte-identity, and the
corpus + fuzz A/B are the gate.

### D4 — residual structural decisions made by rendering

The ~10 sites that decide structure by comparing rendered text
(`tyToStr(t.nInner) == "string"`, `tyToEmitName(x) != ""` used as a representability probe).
Replace with arena predicates. `tyEq` (typecheck.vl) is the model — it already decides
render-equality *structurally, without building the strings*.

### D5 — delete the name columns

Once nothing reads a table's name column for anything but diagnostics, demote it to a
sidecar or delete it. Terminal-condition check: the greps in "How to verify" return only
diagnostic and nominal-lookup hits.

## How to verify (the standing check)

```sh
# structural decisions made by comparing rendered names — must be empty
grep -nE '(tyToStr|tyToEmitName|nodeTyName|canonEmitName)\([^)]*\) *(==|!=)' compiler/*.vl

# tables keyed by a type-name string — must be nominal lookups only
grep -nE '\b(sNames|rlElemName|mvValName|unNames|uVariants)\[[^]]*\] *(==|!=)' compiler/*.vl
```
