# Destringify types — program plan

Status: **IN PROGRESS.** Started 2026-07-24. Supersedes the ad-hoc "rep adoption" slices
(#1009–#1077), which destringified type *resolution*; this program destringifies type
*representation*.

## Terminal condition (checkable, not aspirational)

> No type-name string is used as a **key** or to make a **structural decision**.
> Strings survive only for (a) human-facing rendering — diagnostics, hover, `--json`; and
> (b) genuine **nominal identity** lookup, i.e. a declared name → its arena type.

Everything else keys on an arena type index (`T.tys`) or on `repCanonKey`.

Two consequences worth stating, because they are the ones people get wrong:

- `tyToStr` is **not** a target. 160 uses, almost all diagnostics. It stays.
- `structIndexByName("Cat")` is **not** a target. A declared name *is* the identity; that
  lookup is correct by construction. The target is only where a type's *structure* is
  re-derived from a rendering.

## Why this is worth doing (the evidence)

Every bug family this codebase has fought for months is one defect wearing different hats:
a type gets rendered to text, the text is compared or used as a key, and two structurally
identical types render differently (or two different types render the same).

- `$fnsig` twin functypes — three producers must agree character-for-character; when they
  don't, iso-recursively distinct types and a runtime cast failure.
- The same-fieldset twin family (#978/#996/#1041 and every `shapeFieldTypeCompat`
  refutation arm accreted to patch it) — all retired once resolution went structural.
- #1069: `emitIs` compared `#anon0` against `{foo:string}` with `==` and silently answered
  NO. **Outside** the resolver layer entirely — proof the disease is not confined to the
  area we had been working.

## The current state, measured

`slotCanonKey` is the tell — the function at the heart of every arena-based fix:

```vl
function slotCanonKey(si: i32): string {
  const nm = sNames[si]              // a STRING
  let di = cUserTypes[nm] ?? -1      // parse it back into a type
  ...
  return repCanonKey(di)             // ...then compute the structural key
}
```

The table is a table of *names*; the arena is a resolver layered over it. Resolution is
structural, storage is not.

Type-name-keyed tables (12 of the 34 `string[]` tables in `emit_state`):

| table | refs | layer |
|---|---|---|
| `sNames` | 93 | struct rows |
| `rlElemName` | 84 | ref-list slots |
| `mvValName` | 49 | map-value slots |
| `uVariants` | 49 | union variants |
| `sFieldElemName` | 39 | struct field element types |
| `unNames` | 38 | union names |
| `uFieldElemName` | 25 | variant field element types |
| `cloSigKeys` | 24 | `$fnsig` keys |
| `fRetRArrElem` | 20 | fn return ref-array element |
| `unMemberSet` | 17 | union member sets |
| `sAnonCanon` | 12 | anon-row canon keys |
| `gaeBases` / `gaeParams` | 14 | generic-alias expansion |

## Phases

Each phase is run-diff gated (#1019 discipline: byte-identity is not the gate once
behaviour can change), and each ships independently.

### D0 — arena-index sidecars (foundation, byte-identical, no consumer)

Record, at **intern time**, the arena type index each row denotes:
`sTyIx[]` ∥ `sNames`, `rlElemTyIx[]` ∥ `rlElemName`, `mvValTyIx[]` ∥ `mvValName`,
`unTyIx[]` ∥ `unNames`.

At intern time the minting node is in scope, so this **also covers the rows whose name does
not resolve** — the `#anon` literal rows that `slotCanonKey` currently falls back to
`sAnonCanon` for. Unconsumed → byte-identical. Mirrors #1009 (`nodeRepTyIx`) and #1022
(`sAnonCanon`), both of which shipped byte-identical and then unlocked their consumers.

### D1 — `slotCanonKey` reads the sidecar — SHIPPED, and the plan above was wrong

Landed as: the sidecar owns the rows **a name cannot resolve** (the `#anon` literal shapes),
and `sAnonCanon` is deleted. `slotCanonKey` no longer consults any key-string table.

**The sketch above — "becomes `repCanonKey(sTyIx[si])`", i.e. authoritative over the whole
function — is refuted.** Ahead of the name path it fails 5 suite cases (nullable-struct list
fields, variant reflist fields). The recorded index is the type as of **intern** time; the
name path re-resolves at **query** time; and for name-resolvable rows those disagree once the
arena mutates (`holeMemberTy` grows a hole's shape in place and bumps `tyMutEpoch`). This is
the same shape as the phase-0 probe's 141 benign divergences — a recorded arena type and a
resolver's answer are **not interchangeable by default**.

**Consequence for the later phases, which assumed otherwise:** an arena-index key is only a
drop-in replacement for a name key where the type cannot mutate after recording. Before D2/D3
make an index authoritative, either (a) re-record on mutation, (b) record a *canon key* rather
than an index where the value must be stable, or (c) prove the family is mutation-free. Pick
one deliberately per slice; do not assume.

### D2 — the computed-name interning layer — ATTEMPTED, and it refuted the plan

`rlInternName` / `rlSlotByName` / `mvCanonValName` mint a canonical name by string surgery
and key a slot on the resulting text. The plan said: those canonicalisations exist to make
two spellings of one rep collide, which is `repCanonKey`'s job, so re-key on the canon key
and the helpers delete themselves.

**Measured — half right, and the wrong half matters.**

- *Additive* probe (canon-key consult LAST, after every existing text fallback):
  corpus **byte-identical**, suite green. So on the corpus the canon key never contradicts
  the string surgery.
- *Replacement* (delete the surgery, keep exact-match + canon key): **4 suite failures** —
  `atom-2d-array`, `closure-value-2d-scalar-array-result`,
  `closure-value-2d-nulstring-array-result`, `nested-array-closure-result`.

The cause is not a gap in the canon key; it is a **category error in the plan**.
`rlCanonElemName` folds `boolean[]` and a litunion `K[]` to `i32[]`, and `(string|null)[]`
to `string[]`. Those are **structurally distinct types that share one WasmGC wrapper** —
`i32[]`, `boolean[]` and `K[]` all ride the `lTypeIdx` i32-list backing. The surgery encodes
**rep equivalence**. `repCanonKey` is a canonical key for the **arena type**, so it keeps
them apart — correctly as a type key, wrongly as a slot key.

**The correction, which applies to D3 as well:** the slot layers are keyed on
REPRESENTATION, not on type. Destringifying them needs a **rep key** — a structural
type→rep fold (i32-backed leaves → the i32-list wrapper, string-backed → the string-list
wrapper, litunion → its boxed atom) — not `repCanonKey`. Building `repElemKey(ty)` is the
real D2, and it is a genuine piece of design rather than a re-keying. Until it exists, the
string surgery is *load-bearing* and must stay.

This is the second time this program's plan has been corrected by measurement (see D1). The
pattern is the same both times: an arena artifact that looks like a drop-in for a name key
is answering a subtly different question.

**SHIPPED — `repElemKey(ty)`, the rep key.** Built as the correction prescribed: a structural
type→rep fold in `emit_rep`, and `rlInternName` / `rlSlotByName` re-keyed on it (the deleted
`rlCanonElemName` string-surgery *key*). The fold, arm by arm:

- an i32-backed leaf array (`i32[]` / `boolean[]` / litunion `K[]` / `(boolean|null)[]` /
  `(K|null)[]` — `tyIsI32LeafElem`) → one `$rlI32L` token; a string-backed leaf array
  (`string[]` / `(string|null)[]`) → one `$rlStrL` token (the shared `lTypeIdx` / `$mkListIdx`
  wrappers);
- a MIXED union softens its litunion atoms to `string` (`repCanonKeyGo`'s arm, same niche
  guard) — `K0|i64 ≡ string|i64`;
- **a DECLARED struct keys on its nominal slot** (`repSlotOfTyDecl`), so declared twins
  `type A={v:i32}` / `type B={v:i32}` stay in distinct ref-list slots
  (`structural-twin-reflist-dedup.vl`); an **inline** shape is expanded structurally — its
  arena index is minted fresh per spelling, so an index key would disagree between the intern
  and the lookup (fuzz `(K0 | {w:i32})[] | string` proved it). This nominal/structural split
  is the piece the "just use `repCanonKey`" plan missed on the *struct* end, exactly as the
  array folds are the piece it missed on the *list* end.

Method (the D1/D2 discipline): an **additive probe** first — `rlSlotByName` computed both the
text answer and the `repElemKey` answer on every lookup and reported disagreements; **zero**
over the corpus + **50,400** fuzz programs (seeds 1–14 × depths 4–6 × {plain, `--declared`} ×
300) was the precondition for the replacement. Corpus stays **byte-identical**; the four
reverted-D2 tests pass.

One residual, scoped honestly: the string surgery survives as `rlElemStoredName` for the
element's stored *name* (not its key). Downstream name-consumers that have not yet been
destringified — the `is`-narrowing emit's litunion classifier, `mapValNameOf`,
`structIdxOfElemName` — still read `rlElemName` and need the emit-canonical spelling (a raw
`K0|{w:i32}` makes the `is`-emit pick the union-variant path and fail). The *key* is
destringified; retiring the *name* column is D5's job, once those consumers move to the arena.

### D3 — the `$fnsig` layer (highest risk, highest value)

`cloSigKeyExt` / `annSigKey` / `cloSigKeys`. Three producers must agree on the key text; the
`repSigSlotTokOfKind`→`repStructSlotRep` canon (#1019) already fixed the slot-digit half.
Re-key on the arena signature. **ABI-affecting** — run-diff, not byte-identity, and the
corpus + fuzz A/B are the gate.

### D4 — residual structural decisions made by rendering

The ~10 sites that decide structure by comparing rendered text
(`tyToStr(t.nInner) == "string"`, `tyToEmitName(x) != ""` used as a representability probe).
Replace with arena predicates. `tyEq` (typecheck.vl) is the model — it already decides
render-equality *structurally, without building the strings*.

### D5 — delete the name columns

Once nothing reads a table's name column for anything but diagnostics, demote it to a
sidecar or delete it. Terminal-condition check: the greps in "How to verify" return only
diagnostic and nominal-lookup hits.

## How to verify (the standing check)

```sh
# structural decisions made by comparing rendered names — must be empty
grep -nE '(tyToStr|tyToEmitName|nodeTyName|canonEmitName)\([^)]*\) *(==|!=)' compiler/*.vl

# tables keyed by a type-name string — must be nominal lookups only
grep -nE '\b(sNames|rlElemName|mvValName|unNames|uVariants)\[[^]]*\] *(==|!=)' compiler/*.vl
```
